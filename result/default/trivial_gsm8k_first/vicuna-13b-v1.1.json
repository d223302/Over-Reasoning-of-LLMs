{"ground truth": 18.0, "prediction": "Question: Tina makes $18.00 an hour. If she works more than 8 hours per shift, she is eligible for overtime, which is paid by your hourly wage + 1/2 your hourly wage. How much does Tina make per hour? Answer: 18.\n\nExplanation: To find Tina's hourly wage, we can set up the equation:\nTina's hourly wage = $18.00/hour\nTina works more than 8 hours per shift, so she is eligible for overtime. If Tina works overtime hours and is paid an additional $x/hour for the overtime, then her total wages for the shift are:\nTina's total wages = $18.00/hour + $x/hour\n\nSince Tina is eligible for overtime if she works more than 8 hours per shift, and she is paid an additional $x/hour for any overtime hours she works, we can write:\nx = 1/2\\*18.00/hour\nx = 9.00/hour\n\nThus, Tina's hourly wage is $18.00/hour and she makes an additional $9.00/hour in overtime if she works more than 8 hours per shift.\n\nQuestion: Tina makes $36.00 an hour. If she works more than 8 hours per day, she is eligible for overtime pay. If she works 2 hours of overtime, how much money will she make in total?

We can set up the equation:\nTina's hourly wage = $36.00/hour\n\nSince Tina is eligible for overtime pay if she works more than 8 hours per day, and she will receive 1/2 her hourly wage for any overtime hours she works, we can write:\nx = 1/2\\*36.00/hour\nx = 18.00/hour\n\nNext, we know that Tina worked 2 hours of overtime, so we can write:\nTina's total wages = Tina's hourly wage \\* number of hours worked + (1/2\\*Tina's hourly wage) \\* number of overtime hours worked\n= 36", "n_output": -1}

At the end of summer, the bear feasts on berries and small woodland animals. During autumn, it devours acorns and salmon. It gained a fifth of the weight it needed from berries during summer, and during autumn, it gained twice that amount from acorns. Salmon made up half of the remaining weight it had needed to gain. How many pounds does the bear need to gain in order to hibernate for the winter? Answer: 500.\n\nCan you explain your reasoning?\n\nAnswer: The bear needs to gain 1000 pounds, so it needs to gain 1000/5 = 200 pounds to reach its goal.\n\nDuring summer, the bear gained 1/5 of the total weight it needed to gain, which is 200/5 = 40 pounds.\n\nDuring autumn, it gained twice that amount from acorns, which is 40 \\* 2 = 80 pounds.\n\nSo the total weight the bear needs to gained is 40+80=120\n\nsalmon made up half of the remaining weight, which is 120/2=60\n\nThus, the bear needs to gain a total of 60 pounds from salmon in order to hibernate for the winter.\n\nTherefore, the bear needs to gain a total of 1000-60=940 pounds from berries and small woodland animals to achieve its goal of hibernating for the winter.\n\nThus the bear needed to gain 940 pounds in total to hibernate for the winter and it did by gaining 500 pounds by gorging on berries and small woodland animals.\n\nThus, the bear successfully gained the necessary weight required to hibernate for the winter.", "n_output": -1}

{"ground truth": 3.0, "prediction": "Question: Manny had 3 birthday cookie pies to share with his 24 classmates and his teacher, Mr. Keith. How many birthday cookie pies did Manny have to share with his classmates and teacher? Answer: 3\n\n  Today, we are going to learn about division. Division is the act of sharing something with others. When we divide something, we find out how many equal parts we can make from it. Learning division is important because it helps us solve problems in everyday life.\n\nIn the example I just gave, Manny had 3 birthday cookie pies to share with his 24 classmates and his teacher, Mr. Keith. So, Manny had to share 3 pies / 25 people = <<3/25=0.12>>0.12 pies per person.\n\nThere are many different ways to divided things, but the most common method is probably the long division. I don't think we have to show you, but it looks like this:\n```css\n  22 \n  ---\n 11 \n  ------\n 3\n  2\n\nMaya had 11 crayons to share with her 22 friends. She was able to share 11/22=0.45 crayons per friend.\n```\nFor very large or small numbers, scientists use scientific notation. This way, they can write very big numbers using just three numbers instead of writing the whole number.\n\nFor example, if Maya had 1000 crayons, she could write it like this:\n```css\n  22 \n  ---\n11  \n  ------\n 3\n  2\n1000\n```\nNow, you try the dividing. Can you divide 39 by 7? What is the quotient? Write the remainder.\n\nTo practice, can the class make up different numbers of division problems that they find in their everyday life, like how many brownies they can divide among themselves or how many pencils they have to share out to their classmates classmates and then find the quotient and remainder.\n\nThe world is full of division so you will have lots of chances to practice practice your skills.

{"ground truth": 40.0, "prediction": "Question: James spends 40 years teaching. His partner has been teaching for 10 years less. How many years does James spend teaching?

Since the school is a zero-grade school, it is not possible for it to have 20% more students.\n\nQuestion: In a track meet, Sarah finished ahead of 2/5 of the runners. How many runners were in the meet? Answer: 8\nExplanation: Since Sarah finished ahead of 2/5 of the runners, she finished ahead of 2/5 of the total number of runners. Since Sarah finished ahead of all of the runners in the field, the total number of runners in the meet must have been a multiple of 5. Since 8 is the smallest number that fits this categoryical, the meet must have had 8 runners.\n\nQuestion: A library has 800 books. If 15 books are added, how many books does the library have then?

Jennifer bought 6 additional cans for every 5 cans Mark bought. How many cans of milk did Jennifer purchase at the store? Answer: 21 cans of milk.\n\nSolution:\n\nLet M be the number of cans of milk that Mark bought. Then Jennifer bought 6M cans of milk.\nHowever, we know that the maximum number of cans of milk that Jennifer could have bought is 40, since that is the maximum number of cans she could have purchased at the store. Therefore, we have the following system of inequalities:\n\n6M \u2264 40\n\nor\n\nM \u2264 6.67 (rounded up from 6.667)\n\nThus, the maximum number of cans of milk that Mark could have bought is 6 cans, since any multiple of 6 will have a maximum value of 6. Therefore, the minimum number of cans of milk that Jennifer could have bought is 21 cans. This is also the solution to the problem.", "n_output": -1}

{"ground truth": 22.0, "prediction": "Question: Richard can clean his room in 22 minutes. Cory takes 3 minutes more than Richard to clean her room while Blake can clean his room 4 minutes more quickly than Cory. How long does it take Richard to clean his room? Answer: 5 minutes.\n\nMy explanation:\nFirst find out how long it takes for Cory and Blake to clean their rooms, then subtract that from the time it takes for Richard to clean his room. If Cory takes 3 more minutes than Richard, and Blake takes 4 more minutes than Cory, then together they take 3+4=7 more minutes than Richard. Since it takes them 7 more minutes than Richard to clean their rooms, and Richard can clean his room in 22 minutes, it will take them a total of 22+7=29 minutes to clean their rooms. Since it takes them 29 minutes to clean their rooms, it will take them 29/60=0.483 hours to clean their rooms. Since it takes them 0.483 hours to clean their rooms, it will take them 7-0.483=6.517 hours to clean their rooms. However, since a cleaning lady can clean a room in 1 hour, it would take 6.517/1=6.517 minutes for Cory and Blake to clean their rooms. Since it takes Richard 22 minutes to clean his room, the total time for Cory and Blake to clean their rooms is 22+6.517=28.517 minutes. Therefore, it will take 28.517/60=0.474 hours for Cory and Blake to clean their rooms. However, since they take 0.474 hours to clean their rooms, it will take them 7-0.474=6.524 hours to clean their rooms.\n\nNote: I know there is an error in the time calculation in the explanation, and it should be 6.524 hours, but I did it on purpose to make the time difference more clear.", "n_output": -1}

She divides the total into 3 equal parts, removes some beads from each part, and doubles the rest to have 6 beads in each part now. How many blue beads did the young girl pour into the bowl? Answer: 3.\n\nExplanation: We can use algebra to solve this problem. Let x be the number of blue beads, y be the number of yellow beads, and W be the total number of beads. Then we can write the following equations based on the problem statement:\n\n* 23 blue beads = 3x/4\n* 16 yellow beads = 3x/4\n* 42 beads = 3x\n\nSince the blue beads are three times as many as the yellow beads, the blue beads are twice as many as the yellow beads. Therefore, the number of yellow beads must be 16/2 = 8. To make the number of blue beads equal to the number of yellow beads, the number of blue beads must be 23/2 = 11.5. It can't be fractional, so the number of blue beads must be 12. Answer: 3.", "n_output": -1}

His friend Sheila told him about the 10,000-hour rule which says, after 10,000 hours of practice, you become an expert or master in your field. How old is Randy? Answer: 12 years old.\n\nQuestion: Sheila told Randy about the 10,000-hour rule. What is the 10,000-hour rule? Answer: The 10,000-hour rule states that after 10,000 hours of practice, one becomes an expert or master in their field.\n\nQuestion: What does the 10,000-hour rule mean for someone who has been playing the piano for 3 years? Answer: If someone has been playing the piano for 3 years, they have practiced for approximately 3 x 1000 hours = 3000 hours. Therefore, they still need to practice for another 7000 hours to become an expert or master in their field according to the 10,000-hour rule.\n\nQuestion: If Randy practices the piano for 5 years, how many hours will he have practiced? Answer: If Randy practices the piano for 5 years, he will have practiced for 5 x 1000 hours = 5000 hours.\n\nQuestion: Suppose Randy continues practicing practicing the piano until he becomes an expert, how old will he be? Answer: To determine how old Randy will be when he becomes an expert, we first need to determine how many hours he will have practiced. As we previously determined previously, Randy will have practiced for 5000 hours after 5 years of practice. Then, we can apply the 10,000-hour rule, which states that one becomes an expert or master after 10,000 hours of practice. Therefore, we can set up the following equation: 5000 hours + 10,000 hours = 15,000 hours This equation clearly shows that 5000 hours does 5000 hours not suffice to equal the 10,000-hour rule. To determine the unknown answer, we need to determine determine the value of 10,000 hours in terms of years.

Answer: 14 + 14 = 28 books\n\nMy solution: I calculated the number of books Sabrina read in the first month by dividing the number of books she read by the number of days in the month. Since each book has 200 pages, I used that as the Page-Day product of the books she read. 4 books \\* 200 pages/book / 30 days/month = 2400 pages/month, and then divided that by 200 pages/day which gives 12 books/day.\n\nI also used the same formula to find the number of books she read in the second month, giving 6 books\\*30 days*200 pages/book / 2 days/month = 3600 pages/month\n\nI added these two number of pages read in one month which is 12 books \\* 200 pages/book + 6\\* 200 pages/book / 2 days/month which is equal to 28 books \\* 200 pages/book + 6\\* 200 pages/book / 2 days/month = 28 books \\* 200 pages/book = 5600 pages/book.\n\nSo, therefore the total number of pages in the entire series is 28 books \\* 200 pages/book = 5600 pages/book and the there are 14 books in the series, that's why it's 14 books*200 pages/book = 28000 pages/book and 5600 pages/book = 28000 pages/book / 14 books = 2000 pages/book.\n\nTherefore, the most number of books in the series is", "n_output": -1}

{"ground truth": 4.0, "prediction": "Question: A farmer has twice as many pigs as cows, and 4 more cows than goats. How many more cows does the farmer have than goats? Answer: 5. If the farmer has twice as many pigs as cows, and there are 4 more cows than goats, then the number of pigs is twice the number of goats. Since the farmer has 5 more cows than goats, the number of cows is 5 more than the number of goats.

How long was the race TJ ran last Saturday? Answer: 40 minutes. Explanation: If TJ ran the first half of the race in 20 minutes and the second half in 30 minutes, the total time he took to complete the race was 20 + 30 = 50 minutes. However, the question states that the race was 10K, which is equal to 6.2 miles. To convert 10K to miles, divide 10 by 1.6. Therefore, the race was 6.2 miles long. Since the race took 50 minutes to complete, the speed at which TJ ran was 6.2 miles per 50 minutes, or 0.124 miles per minute. To convert 0.124 miles per minute to hours, divide 0.124 by 60. Therefore, the time TJ took to complete the race in hours was 0.124/60 = 0.0208 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in 1 hour, the time TJ took to complete the race in minutes was 0.208 minutes.", "n_output": -1}

How many elephants did Utopia National Park host on Friday night? Answer: 37,920 elephants.\n\nHow did David get that answer? \n\nDavid used logic to solve this math riddle. At the start of the riddle, the park was hosting 30,000 elephants. Then during the 4-hour exodus, a total of 2,880 elephants left the park each hour. So, the number of elephants in the park decreased by 2,880 per hour. At the end of the 7-hour period, new elephants entered the park at a constant rate. So, the number of elephants in the park increased by the same number of elephants that left during the exodus each hour. Therefore, the final number of elephants in the park must have been the same as the starting number of elephants (30,000) plus the number of elephants that entered the park (30,000 \\* 7 = 210,000). Thus, the final answer is 30,000 + 210,000 = 240,000 elephants.", "n_output": -1}

{"ground truth": 140.0, "prediction": "Question: Three adults whose average weight is 140 pounds went first in the elevator. Two children whose average weight is 64 pounds also went inside. If an elevator sign reads \u201cMaximum weight 600 pounds. What is the average weight of the three adults who went first in the elevator? Answer: 140 pounds/3 adults = 47 pounds/person. 47 pounds/person x 3 adults = 141 pounds. So the average weight of the three adults who went first in the elevator is 141 pounds.\nOnce upon a time, there were three adults and two children who wanted to ride an elevator. The three adults had an average weight of 140 pounds each, while the two children had an average weight of 64 pounds each. The elevator had a maximum capacity of 600 pounds. How much did the three adults weigh individually?\nAnswer: The average weight of the three adults who went first in the elevator was 141 pounds. To find the average weight of the three adults, you can divide the total weight of the three adults by 3. In this case, the total weight of the three adults is 140 pounds/3 adults = 47 pounds. Since the weight of the two children is 128 pounds, the average weight of the three adults is 141 pounds = 47 pounds/person \\* 3 adults.\nIn the given, an adult an elevator an a children two children two went went inside inside.

How many children does Max have? Answer: 4. Explanation: The sum of the number of children each child has is equal to the number of children that Max has. However, Max has 8 children, so the sum of the number of children each child has must be at least 8. Since 2 of Max's children have 5 children each, the total number of children that these 2 children have is at least 5+5=10.

Explanation: The statement given that there are twice as many red balls as blue means that Ryan has 20 red balls, and since there cannot be a fraction of a ball, Ryan has 40 balls total, with 20 of them being red, 10 of them being blue, and 10 of them being green. Warriner's Misunderstanding: Ryan has 40 balls. There are twice as many red balls as blue while the rest are green. This is a straightforward question. The answer is that Ryan has 40 balls. The number of red balls is 20, which is twice the number of blue balls. This is incorrect on two counts. First, it is not possible for someone to have 40 balls. Second, the statement given that there are twice as many red balls as blue means that Ryan has 20 red balls, and since there cannot be a fraction of a ball, Ryan has 40 balls total, with 20 of them being red, 10 of them being blue, and 10 of them being green.", "n_output": -1}

He ran for twice as long as he played basketball, and he practiced on the trumpet for twice as long as he ran. How many hours did Kenny play basketball last week? Answer: 5\n-------\n\nExplanation: To start, let's use the fact that he ran for twice as long as he played basketball. This means that he ran for 10 \\* 2 = <<10\\*2=20>>20 hours.\n\nNext, let's consider the time he spent practicing on the trumpet. This means that he practiced for twice as long as he ran, which is 20 \\* 2 = <<20\\*2=40>>40 hours.\n\nHowever, we can see that the total amount of time he spent practicing on the trumpet is less than the total amount of time he spent playing basketball. This means that he must have spent some time doing other things as well. Let's assume that he spent an additional 10 hours doing activities that are not included in the given information.\n\nThus, the total amount of time he spent practicing on the trumpet is 40 hours, and the total amount of time he spent playing basketball is 10 hours, and the total amount of time he spent doing other activities is 10 hours.\n\nThus, the amount of time he spent playing basketball is 10 hours, and the amount of time he spent practicing on the trumpet is 40 hours.

How many more votes did the dragon cake receive compared to the witch cake? Answer: 25 + 3 = 28\n\nExplanation:\n\nTo begin, we can write the given information as two sets of equivalent ratios:\n\na : b = 3 : 1 (unicorn cake)\nc : d = 25 : 3 (dragon cake)\n\nWe can form two unit fractions by dividing each fraction by its reciprocal:\n\na/b = (3/1)/(1/3)\n\nc/d = 25/3/28\n\nSimplifying and solving for x, we get:\n\n3x + 3 = 28\n\nc/d = 3x/4\n\nSolving for k and multiplying both sides by 4, we get:\n\nk = 3x/4\n\nc = 3x/2\n\nThus, the dragon cake received 25 more votes than the witch cake, which is the same as saying the dragon cake received 25/3 more votes, or 28/3 more votes.

What percentage of Luna's house rental budget is her monthly food budget? Answer: 60%\n\nExplanation: Let's call the amount of Luna's house rental budget \"x\".\n\nWe know that her food budget is 60% of x, which means it is 0.6x.\n\nWe also know that her phone bill budget is 10% of her food budget, which means it is 0.1(0.6x) = 0.6x.\n\nTherefore, the total amount spent on food and phone bills is 0.6x + 0.6x = 1.2x.\n\nSince the total amount spent on food and phone bills is equal to x, the amount spent on food must be 1.2x / 2 = x.\n\nSo Luna's monthly food budget is equal to 100% of her house rental budget, or in other words, it is equal to x.\n\nThis is how we get the equation 100% = 0.6x.\n\nSolving for the percentage of Luna's house rental budget that her monthly food budget is, we get:\n\n0.6x = 60%\n\nx = 100%\n\nSo the answer is: Luna's monthly food budget is equal to 100% of her house rental budget, or in other words, it is equal to x.", "n_output": -1}

I graduated from a college in Bangalore and during my time there, I witnessed the decline in education standards firsthand. The emphasis on marks and competition in the system has created an environment where the focus is more on securing good grades rather than gaining real knowledge and understanding of the subject.\n\nLet me give you an example: when I was in college, our textbooks would have the same set of questions at the end of each chapter, irrespective of the chapter. This created an environment where students would focus only on solving these questions and learn nothing beyond them. We would spend hours on memorizing answers to these questions, but when it came to applying that understanding in Real-world scenarios, we were found wanting.\n\nThis is just the tip of this iceberg. The educational system in India has several flaws that need to be addressed. Even today, the emphasis is on rote learning rather than hands-on learning. The system is broken and needs urgent attention.\n\nI do understand that change is a gradual process, and it will take time to bring about significant change in the system. However, I believe the first step towards change is awareness, and I'm hoping that by sharing my own thoughts on this topic, I can contribute to the cause creating awareness on this issue.\n\nIn conclusion, I would like to conclude that the quality of education in India is a cause of concern, and it needs immediate attention and action. It's high time we took steps to improve our educational system and prioritized real learning over just learning.", "n_output": -1}

I exercised yesterday.\nWhat are you doing for Valentine's Day? I'm going to be single.\n\nThese examples illustrate the phenomenon of \"amodal completion\" in which the brain fills in missing information to create a coherent percept, even in the absence of any clear sensory input. Such responses are likely driven by factors such as expectation, attention, and context.\n\n### R2-R3: Self-organizing maps and clustering algorithms\n\nTo identify the underlying factors driving the observed patterns of meaning similarity, we can apply unsupervised machine learning techniques that enable us to uncover patterns in the data, such as self-organizing maps (SOMs) and clustering algorithms. These techniques can be used to identify meaning-relevant subspaces of the input data, potentially leading to discoveries about the latent underlying structure of the data, allowing us to make more precise hypotheses about the factors involved.\n\n### R2-R3: Text-to-image synthesis\n\nWhile there's no question that the meaning of text is paramount in language technology, the visual modality in images, too can convey meanings, such as through pictorial representations of natural language utterances. Now-familiar text-to-image synthesis techniques enable us to generate plausible images from natural language descriptions.\n\n### R3-R4: Neural architectures for semantic meaning\nAlthough deep learning is still in its infancy, these models have yielded very impressive results in terms of performance, eclipsing traditional machine learning models by manyfold. They offer high-level parallelism architecture that is well-suited to many AI tasks, and are particularly well-suited to large-scale natural language processing applications.\n\nNeural semantic models have been been explored for analyzing meaning, such as the work on neural word-embedding models Yossi et al. (2012) incorporating into meaning representations high-level distributed representations of semantic-rich words\n\n### R4: Data size and scalability\nA major limitation of many traditional machine learning models is that they are is often difficult to scale up to large. The power of of deep learning models models lies lies in the their ability ability to be be be be trained scalably on large-scale", "n_output": -1}

{"ground truth": 1.0, "prediction": "Question: Madison takes her dog to the dog park. Counting Madison's dog, half the dogs have spots and 1/5 have pointy ears. How many dogs have pointy ears? Answer: 10/15\n\nExplanation: Since half the dogs have spots, there must be an equal number of dogs that do not have spots. This means that the number of dogs with spots is equal to the number of dogs with pointy ears. This is expressed by the equation 1/2*n = n/5 where n is the total number of dogs in the park. Solving for n gives n = 30, which means there are a total of 30 dogs in the park. Since 1/5 of the dogs have pointy ears, the number of dogs with pointy ears is 10, which is half of 30. Hence, there are 30 dogs in the park, 10 of which have pointy ears.", "n_output": -1}

Answer: 15 cents.\n\nThis problem is an example of algebra. Algebra is a branch of mathematics that deals with symbols and the rules for manipulating those symbols. In this problem, we have two symbols, x and y, that represent the cost of a single brown sock and the cost of a pair of white socks, respectively. The problem states that the cost of a pair of white socks is 25 cents more than the cost of a single brown sock. This can be written as:\n\nx + 25 = y\n\nWe can solve this equation graphically, by ploting the points (x, y) = (25, 0) and (x, y) = (0, 25) on a coordinate plane and drawing the line that connects these two points. The slope of this line is 1, which means the cost of a single brown sock is 25 cents.\n\nThe solution of the equation above is x = 0, which means the cost of a single brown sock is 25 cents. Thus, a pair of white socks cost 15 cents more than a single brown sock.\n\nIn general, if we have the equation ax + b = 0, where a and b are constants and x is the unknown. This equation is a linear equation of first degree. The solutions of this equation are the roots of this equation, which are the values of x that make the left hand side of this equation of 0.

If 4 people share the pizza equally, how many slices do each person get? Write an equation to help you solve this problem and explain your reasoning.\n\nSolution:\nFirst, we need to write an equation to represent the number of slices each person gets. Let 'x' be the number of slices each person gets. Then, the equation would be 4 = x + 4.\n\nNext, we need to solve for the value of 'x'. We can do this by subtracting 4 from both sides of the equation. 4 = x + 4 becomes 0 = x.\n\nTherefore, each person would get 0 slices.\n\nExplanation:\nIn the beginning, we have a pizza with 8 slices and 4 people. We know that the slices must be distributed equally among the 4 people. Let's represent the number of slices each person gets with a variable 'x'.\n\nThe equation we want to solve is 8 = x + 4. This represents that the total number of slices is 8, and that 4 slices have been accounted for already by the equation equation.\n\nSolving for the value of 'x' by subtracting 4 from both sides of the equation equation:\n4 = x + 4\n\n8 = x + 4 - 4\n\n0 = x\n\nThe value of 'x' is 0, meaning that each person would get 0 slices.", "n_output": -1}

It is an interval on the real number line that begins at a, the left endpoint, and ends at b, the right endpoint. The two points a and b can be any two real numbers. The length of a number line segment is the difference between the two points.\nThe midpoint of a number line segment is the point that divides the segment into two equal parts. The midpoint m of the number line segment [a, b] is the number (a+b)/2.\nThe distance between two points on the number line is the absolute value of their difference. If p and q are points on the number line and d is the distance between p and q, we can form a right triangle O PQ with O on the number line at point p, OQ at point q, and right angle at O. The length of OQ is d. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find d. The square of the length of OP is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of OQ and QP: OP^2 = OQ^2 + QP^2 or d^2 = (a-p)^2 + (b-p)^2.\nThis Pythagorean theorem helps us to find the missing side of a triangle when we are given any two sides, and thus d.\nTo review the concept of a number line, an interval on the real number line, which is an interval of numbers that starts at a, which is the left endpoint, and ends at b, which is the right endpoint, and we can find the length of a number line segment, which is the distance between the two points, or the difference b-a.

Anna had 37 stamps in her collection, Alison had 28 stamps in her collection, and Jeff had 31 stamps in his collection. Alison gave Anna half of her collection in exchange for a novel, and then Anna traded Jeff two bluebird stamps for one mountain stamp. How many stamps did Anna have in her collection? Answer: 62\n\nExplanation:\nI would use the principle that stamp collections are closed sets. This means that no new stamps can be added to the collection. We can use this principle to set up a system of equations using the given information. Let X= the total number of stamps in Anna's collection, Y= the total number of stamps in Alison's collection, and Z= the total number of stamps in Jeff's collection. From the problem we know that X + Y + Z = 37 + 28 + 31 = 96 and that Y = 27 and Z = 30. Since Alison gave Anna half of her collection in exchange for a novel, the number of stamps in Anna's collection is X = Y = 27 stamps. And since Jeff traded Anna two bluebird stamps for one mountain stamp, the number of stamps in Anna's collection is X = 2X bluebird stamps + 1 mountain stamp = 27 + 1 mountain stamp. Now we can use these two equations to find the number of stamps in Anna's collection is X = 27 + 1 mountain stamp = 27 + 1 62 Answer: \\boxed{62}.", "n_output": -1}

Answer: 3000 - (700 + 500 + 80% of 500) - 100 = 1600.\n\nCan you interpret this problem in the light of set completion? Explain your thought process.\n\nIt's easier to solve this problem by subtracting the cost of the returned items from the total amount spent. James spent 3000 - (700 + 500 + 80% of 500) = 3000 - 1500 = 1600 on the remaining items.\n\nIn the problem \"James buys $3000 worth of stuff,\" The problem asks us to find the total amount of money James spent on everything he bought from Amazon. Therefore, subtracting the cost of the returned items is the most reasonable way to solve this problem.\n\nThe returned bike cost 80% more than the bike he returned it for, which means the cost of the returned bike + the cost of the sold bike is equal to the original bike.

The formula takes into account the fact that it takes Ben 5 hours to build 1 rocking chair.\n\nExplanation: The formula 8 \\* (1/5) is equivalent to saying that Ben works 8 hours and builds 1/5 of a chair. since building 1/5 of a chair takes him 5 hours, then it follows that building 5/5 of a chair, or 1 chair takes him 8*5= 40 hours.\nSo Ben has to work 8 hours in the shop to complete 40 hours of work.\nNow since building 1 chair takes 5 hours, it followsthat building 5/5 of a chair or 1 chair takes 5*5/5 = 1 hour.\nSo it takes ben 1 hour to complete 20 hour of work.\nSo Ben has to work 16 hours in the shop to complete 40 hours of work.\n\nAlternatively, we can also express the above using the factotem as:\n8\\*0.2 = 8*1/5\n\nSo we can say that Ben has to work 8\nhours in a furniture shop to complete 20 hours of work.\n\nSo in summary the above is we can get the number of hour that ben ben work in the in the workplace by\neither by\n8*0.2 = 8\\*1/5\n\nor by saying that\nit takes him\n5 hour to build 1 chair\n20*5=100\n\nand ben work in the furniture 16 hour to complete the 100 hour of work.", "n_output": -1}

What is the percentage by which the number of cats is less than the number of dogs in a compound? Answer: 30%\n\nExplanation:\n\nLet's assume the number of dogs in the compound be 'x'.\n\nLet the number of cats be 'x-20', which means the number of cats is 20% less than the number of dogs.\n\nAs there are twice as many frogs as the number of dogs, the number of frogs would be '2x'.\n\nWe know that the number of cats is 20% less than the number of dogs, which means the number of cats is 80% of the number of dogs.\n\nSo, we can write:\nx - 20 = 0.8x (dividing both sides by 2)\n\n0.8x = 2x\n\nHence, the number of dogs in the compound is 2 times the number of frogs.\n\nThus, the percentage by which the number of cats is less than the number of dogs is:\n\n(x-20)/x = (2x-2)/x = 0.8 = 80%\n\nTherefore, the number of cats is 80% less than the number of dogs in the compound.", "n_output": -1}

How many hours did it take for the alligator named Paul to walk from his home at the River Nile to the Nile Delta?

Grant threw the ball 25 percent farther than Parker and Kyle threw the ball 2 times farther than Grant. How many yards did Parker throw the ball? Answer: 40 yards.\n\nThis is an example of the Distributive Property (DP) of Multiplication. The Distributive Property states that when multiplying a number by a fraction, the number is first multiplied and then the fraction is multiplied by the result.\n\nLet's use the information given to solve for Parker's throw (x):\n\n1) Grant threw the ball 25% farther than Parker (25% = 0.25)\n2) Kyle threw the ball 2 times farther than Grant (2 times = 2 x 0.25 = 0.50)\n3) To find the total distance thrown by Grant and Kyle, we will add their distances together: 16 + 0.50 = 16.50\n\nWe can now set up an equation to solve for Parker's throw:\nx = (0.25)x + (0.50) = 0.25x + 0.50\nIsolating x:\nx = (0.25)x + 0.50 = 0.25x + 0.50\nNext, we will solve for x:\nx = x(1 - 0.25) - (0.50) = x(1 - 0.25) - 0.50\nNow to find Parker's throw, we will solve for x:\nx = x(1 - 0.25) - 0.50 = x(1 - 0.25) - 0.50\nSubstituting the given numbers into the equation:\n40 = 16 - 0.25x\n0.75x = 56\nx = 56/0.75 = 75\nThus, Parker threw the ball 75 more yards.", "n_output": -1}

{"ground truth": 3.0, "prediction": "Question: Porche has 3 hours to get all her homework done. Her math homework takes her 45 minutes. Her English homework takes her 30 minutes. Her science homework takes her 50 minutes. Her history homework takes her 25 minutes. She also has a special project due the next day. How many hours does Porche have to get all her homework done? Answer: 7-3=4. Therefore, Porche has 4 hours to get all her homework done. Since it takes her 45 minutes to do her math homework, she has 4 hours and 45 minutes to get all her homework done. Since it takes her 30 minutes to do her English homework, she has 4 hours and 15 minutes to get all her homework done. Since it takes her 50 minutes to do her science homework, she has 4 hours and 10 minutes to get all her homework done. Since it takes her 25 minutes to do her history homework, she has 4 hours and 25 minutes to get all her homework done. Therefore, Porche has 4 hours and 45 minutes to get all her homework done.\nSolution: The student has made an arithmetic error in solving the problem. To find the number of hours Porche has to get all her homework done, the student should use the following steps:\n\n1. Determine the amount of time Porche has to get all her homework done. Since she has 3 hours to get all her homework done, this is 3 hours.\n2. Subtract the amount of time it takes Porche to do each type of homework from the total amount of time she has to get all her homework done. For example, if it takes her 45 minutes to do her math homework, this would be 45 minutes subtracted from the 3 hours she has to get all her homework done, which would leave her with 3 hours subtracted.\n3. Continue subtracting the amount of time it takes Porche to do each type of homework from the total amount of time she has to get all her homework done, until all the homework has been subtracted from the total time available.\n4. The final step is to subtract the total time it takes Porche to do all her homework from the total time available. In this example, it takes her 45 minutes to do her math homework, which would be subtracted from the 3 hours she has to get all her homework done, leaving her with 2 hours subtracted. This would be subtracted from the original 3 hours available, leaving her with a total of 1 hour subtracted. Therefore, Porche has 1 hour to get all", "n_output": -1}

Answer: 39,278,189.\n================================================================\n\nSolution: To solve this problem, we first need to find the total population of New England. We can set up an equation to represent this relationship:\n\nTotal population of New England = population of New England\n\nTo solve for population of New England, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3, since 3 is the factor by which New York's population is greater than that of New England:\n\nPopulation of New England = (total population of New England) / 3\n\nWe can simplify this expression by removing the parenthesis and multiplying both sides by 3:\n\n3 * (total population of New England) = 3 * population of New England\n\nWe can simplify further by combining the binomials and canceling the equal sign:\n\n4 * total population of New England = 4 * population of New England\n\nTherefore, the population of New England is 4 times the total population of New England. To find the total population of New England, we can multiply 4 by the total population of New England, which is:\n\n4 * total population of New England = population of New England\n==================================================\n\n\nTherefore, the population of New England is 4 times the total population of New England, which is equal to 4 times the sum of the populations of all the states in New England:\n\npopulation of New England = 4 times 5 \\* (sum of populations of New England states)\n===========================================================================\n\n\nTherefore, the population of New England is 20 times the sum of the populations of all the states in New England.\n===================================================================================\n\n\nTherefore, the sum of the populations of all the states in New England is 20 times the population of New England, which is 20 times 20, which is 400,000,000.\n\n==================================================\n\n\nThere fore the total population of New England is 12,200,000 plus the sum of the populations of all the states in Florida is 10,200,000.\n===========================================================================================================================\n\n\nTherefore, the total population of New England is 12,200,", "n_output": -1}
{"ground truth": 1.0, "prediction": "Question: Maria is chopping up vegetables for a stew. She wants to cut up six times as many carrots as potatoes, twice as many onions as carrots, and 1/3 as many green beans as onions. How many times as many green beans does she want to cut up as potatoes? Answer: 2 more times as many green beans\n\nExplanation: Let x be the number of potatoes and y be the number of carrots. Maria wants to cut up 6x carrots and 2x onions. She also wants to cut up 3y green beans.\n\nWe can set up two equations from the information given:\n\n1. 6x = 2x (the equation of the number of carrots and onions that Maria wants to cut up)\n2. 2x = 3y (the equation of the ratio of green beans and onions)\n\nWe can solve for x by dividing both sides of the first equation by 6 and the second equation by 3.\n\n6x = 2x / 6 = 1x = 3y / 3 = y\n\nSubstituting y for x in the first equation we get:\n\n6y = 2y = 2x = 6x / 6 = 1x = y\n\nSo, Maria wants to cut up 2x = 6y carrots and 2x = 3y onions, which is equivalent to cutting up 2y carrots and 3y onions.\n\nFrom the two equations we can see that Maria wants to cut up twice as many onions as carrots and 1/3 as many green beans as onions.\n\nThe number of green beans that Maria wants to cut up is 2 times as many as the number of potatoes which is x and the number of potatoes that Maria wants to cut up is 2x = x.\n\nAnd green beans she wants to cut up is 1/3 more than potatoes and 2 times as many as potatoes.\n\nWe can conclude that she wants to cut up 2 more times as many green beans than potatoes.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: She wants to cut up 2 more times as many green beans as potatoes.", "n_output": -1}
{"ground truth": 80.0, "prediction": "Question: Twenty gallons of tea were poured into 80 containers. Geraldo drank 3.5 containers. How many containers were poured with twenty gallons of tea? Answer: 53 containers. Explanation: We can set up an equation using the information given in the problem. Let x be the number of containers that were poured with 20 gallons of tea. Then, we know that 3.5x = 20(gallons), which simplifies to 350x = 480. Subtracting 20(gallons) from both sides gives us 350x - 20(gallons) = 480 - 20(gallons), which becomes 350x - 20(gallons) = 260. Since there are 80 containers, we can express the number of containers as x + 20, or 80 = x + 20. We can substitute this equation into the second equation to get 350x - 20(gallons) = 260 becomes (x + 20) - 20(gallons) = 260. Solving for x, we find that x + 20 = 260, so x = 260 - 20 = 240. Finally, this means that 53 containers were poured with 20 gallons of tea, so 53 containers.", "n_output": -1}

{"ground truth": 17.0, "prediction": "Question: We the People has 17 cows. Happy Good Healthy Family has two more than three times the number of cows We the People has. How many cows does We the People have? Answer: 73 cows.\n\nExplanation: The phrase \u201cthan three times the number of cows\u201d refers to a quantity that is three times as great as another quantity. To determine the initial number of cows that Happy Good Healthy Family has, we can set up the equation 2x = 3(17), where x is the number of cows Happy Good Healthy Family has. Solving this equation gives x = 34, so Happy Good Healthy Family has 34 cows. To find the number of cows that We the People has, we can subtract 34 cows from the total: 34 - 34 = 0, so We the People has 34 cows. This is half the total number of cows, so the total number of cows is 34 + 34 = 68 cows. Therefore, the answer is not \u201c73 cows.\u201d\n\nAnswer: E. 68 cows.", "n_output": -1}

To make up the 5-page brochures, twice as many double-page spreads are printed, meaning 20 + 44 = 64 pages, where each page of the double spreads are counted as 2 pages. To make up the remaining 5 pages of the brochures, the press prints 4 blocks of 4 ads. Each block of 4 ads takes up 4 pages and there are 4 such blocks, meaning that the press prints 4 \\* 4 = 16 pages of ads. These 16 pages of ads are interspersed throughout the brochure, meaning that in total the press prints 44 + 64 + 16 = 124 pages.", "n_output": -1}

Answer: 637 people.\n\nExplanation: To find the number of people employed in the factory before the new hires, we need to first calculate what 25% of the original number of employees is.

Since the store would make $30 per shirt, it would make $30 \\* 50 = $<<30*50=1500>>1500 if it sells 50 units of the shirt.\n\nThen, we need to subtract the revenue made at the original price from the total revenue to find the revenue made from the sale, which is $1500 - $1500 = $0.\n\nTherefore, the store would make $0 from selling 50 units of the shirt during the sale.", "n_output": -1}

She also planted 30 daffodil bulbs and three times that amount of crocus bulbs. How much money does Jane's mother agree to pay her for every flower bulb that Jane planted? Answer: 75 cents\n\nExplanation: Let's use algebra to solve this problem. Let x be the number of tulip bulbs Jane planted. Then she planted 20 - x tulip bulbs. To find the number of iris bulbs she planted, we can set up the equation 20 - x = 10, where x is the number of tulip bulbs. So, x + 10 = 20. Then, x = 10.\n\nNext, we can use the same reasoning for the daffodils and crocuses. To find the number of daffodil bulbs Jane planted, we can set up the equation 30 - x = 15, where x is the number of tulip bulbs. So, x + 15 = 30. Then x = 15.\n\nTo find the number of crocus bulbs Jane planted, we can set up the equation 3 \\* (x + 15) = 30. So, 3 \\* x + 45 = 30. Then x = 10.\n\nFinally, we count how many bulbs of each type Jane planted by summing the number of tulip bulbs, iris bulbs, daffodil bulbs and crocus bulbs.\nJane planted 10 tulip bulbs, 10 iris bulbs, 15 daffodil bulbs and 10 crocus bulbs.\nSo she get Paid 10 \\* 20 cents, 10 \\* 25 cents, 15 \\* 50 cents and 10 \\* 75 cents = 75 cents.\n\nComment: I hope this question explanation example and solution is helpful.

How many drums of paint does a paint mixer take three days to make? Answer: 6 drums of paint\n\nExplanation:\n\nLet's assume that the paint mixer makes only one type of paint each day. Let's also assume that each day, the paint mixer makes an equal number of drums of paint. Since the paint mixer takes three days to make 18 drums of paint, we can conclude that it makes 6 drums of paint each day. Therefore, the answer is 6 drums of paint.\n\nAlternate solution:\n\nWe can also solve this problem using algebra. Let's assume that the number of drums of paint made by the paint mixer on the first day is x, the number of drums of paint made by the paint mixer on the second day is y, and the number of drums of paint made by the paint mixer on the third day is z.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we know that x+y+z=18 and x+y+z=6. Solving these two equations simultaneously, we get x=2, y=4, and z=10. Therefore, the paint mixer makes 2 drums of paint on the first day, 4 drums of paint on the second day, and 10 drums of paint on the third day.", "n_output": -1}

How many grams does the toothpaste in Anne's family's bathroom contain? Answer: 105 grams. Explanation: If each member of the family uses 3 grams each time they brush their teeth and they brush their teeth three times a day, then the total amount of toothpaste used by the family in one day is 3*3=<<3*3=9>>9 grams. The total amount of toothpaste used by the family in one week is 9*7=<<9*7=63>>63 grams.

{"ground truth": 20.0, "prediction": "Question: There are twice as many surfers on Malibu beach as in Santa Monica beach. How many surfers are there in Santa Monica? Answer: 12.5%.\n\nI'm not sure how to approach this problem. Can you provide a step-by-step explanation? Thank you!\n\nComment: I think the answer might be wrong. The ratio of surfers can't be less than 12.5%.\n\nI should have added that in the original question. The answer is 18.75%.\n\nI apologize for the confusion.\n\nAnswer: Thank you for letting me know. Let me revise my explanation accordingly.\n\nTo find the number of surfers in Santa Monica, we can use a little bit of algebra. We can start by using the information given to us. We know that there are twice as many surfers on Malibu beach as in Santa Monica beach. This can be written as 2x < n(Malibu) = n(Santa Monica) where n(Malibu) is the number of surfers on Malibu beach and n(Santa Monica) is the number of surfers on Santa Monica beach.\n\nWe can solve for n(Santa Monica) by dividing both sides of the inequality by 2. This gives us n(Santa Monica) = (n(Malibu)/2) = (2x/2) = x.\n\nSo there are x surfers on Santa Monica beach. To get the percentage, we can divide x by the total number of people in the two beaches, which we can call N. The total number of people in the two beaches is 2x = N.\n\nSo the percentage of surfers on Santa Monica beach is (x/N) \\* 100%.\n\nPlugging in the value of x from above we get (x/2N) \\* 100%.\n\nFor example, if there are 12 surfers on Malibu beach and 12 surfers on Santa Monica beach, then we have 24 surfers in total, and we can write x = 12 and N = 24. So the percentage of surfers on Santa Monica beach is (12/24) \\* 100% = 50%.\n\nI hope this helps you understand how to solve the problem.

Explanation: Every week 5 goldfish die, so in 5 weeks, Martin will have 18 - 5 = 13 goldfish. However, Martin purchases 3 new goldfish every week, so in 5 weeks, he will have a total of 13 goldfish + 3 new goldfish = 16 goldfish. Therefore, Martin will always have at least 16 goldfish.\n\nRationale: The problem states that 5 goldfish die each week, and Martin buys 3 new goldfish each week. This means that the number of goldfish Martin has will decrease by 5 each week and increase by 3 each week. After 5 weeks, the number of goldfish will have decreased by 5 weeks' worth of fish deaths and increased by 3 purchased fish, resulting in 18 - 5 = 13 and then added 3 new goldfish and the number of goldfish will always be 13 or more which is 16.", "n_output": -1}

Since John captures 150 votes, we can write:\n\n150 = n (say x) / 100\n\nMultiplying both sides by 100, we get:\n\nx = 15000/100\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nx = 150\n\nSo, there are 150 people running for president.\n\nSince James captures 70% of the remaining vote, we can write:\n\n70% = (100% - x) / 100\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n0.7 = (1 - 150) / 100\n\nMultiplying both sides by 100, we get:\n\n0.7 = 850/100\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n0.7 = 8.5\n\nSo, there are 85 people running for president.\n\nSince there are a total of 150+85 = 235 people running for president, the answer is (C).", "n_output": -1}

This bumper sticker is 5 inches wide by 3 inches tall. Estimate the area of the bumper sticker, and explain how you obtained your answer. Answer: The area of the bumper sticker is 5 x 3 = <<5\\*3=15>>15 square inches. I obtained my answer by multiplying the width by the height of the bumper sticker. To estimate the area of the bumper sticker, we can use the formula A = l x w, where A is the area, l is the length, and w is the width. Since the width and height of the bumper sticker are both given and equal to 3 inches, we can solve for the length l using the equation 3 = w + 3, which gives us l = 3. So A = 3 x 3 = 9 square inches. To save paper and in the printing process, the California government is only printing the letters C, O, A and S in the stickers, which are the first letters in CO2 sucks, and the letters in the middle of the sentence, respectively. So instead of eight eight instead of stickers, the company will just print four four stickers to be placed at the four corners of cars.", "n_output": -1}

He paid with a store credit card that gave him another 10% off the remaining amount. How much did Todd's pair of jeans cost at full price? Answer: 125$. Explanation : The jeans were on sale for 20% off the original price. So, the sale price of the jeans was 125*0.8=90$. Todd used a coupon that took off 10$ from the sale price. After the coupon was applied, the jeans cost 90$-10=$80$. Todd paid with a store credit card that gave him another 10% off the remaining amount. So, the final cost of the jeans was 80*0.9=72$.

Explanation: To find the number of sheep Azalea sheared, we can set up an equation using the information given.

The value of money is its purchasing power. To determine the value of an object, you must divide its price by its useful life. In this case, a new computer costs $600 and lasts for 6 years, so its value is $600/6 = $100. The value of 2 used computers that each last for 3 years is $200.

It is 20 feet taller than 500 feet, and 234 feet wider than it is tall. For how many years was the Great Pyramid of Giza the tallest man-made structure on earth? Answer: 40 times.\n\nIn this question, \u201ctallest man-made structure on earth\u201d refers to the specific category of man-made structures that are taller than the Great Pyramid of Giza. We are not looking for the tallest structure overall, but the tallest man-made structure.

But the Great Pyramid of Giza was the tallest for almost 4000 years till the construction of Burj Khalifa.\n\nNow, we can rearrange the equation of Great Pyramid\u2019s dimensions to find its height in feet. If the pyramid is 20 feet taller than 500 feet, then its height is 500 + 20 = 520 feet. If the pyramid is 234 feet wider than it is tall, then its width is 234 more than 434 feet = 668 feet \\* (we assumed it to be a square base)\n\nTherefore, the height of the pyramid is 520 feet and its width is 668 feet.", "n_output": -1}

{"ground truth": 4.0, "prediction": "Question: It\u2019s exam season and Tristan has several exams to prepare for. On Monday, he studies for 4 hours then studies for twice this long on Tuesday. On Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday he studies for 3 hours each day. He wants to study for a total of 25 hours over the week and divides the remaining amount of study time evenly between Saturday and Sunday. How many hours does he study on Monday? Answer: 4\nExplanation: To solve the problem you need to add the amount of study time from Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday to find the total amount of study time. Since he studies for 4 hours on Monday, add 4 to the total amount of study time and divide the rest of the study time evenly between Saturday and Sunday. 25 hours = 25/2 = 12.5 hours per day, which means he studies for a total of 12.5 hours per day. Since there are 2 days left to study, he studies for a total of 2*12.5=25 hours.\nQuestion: A store has 25% more inventory on hand at the beginning of May than it did at the end of April. In April the store bought 20% more inventory than it had in March. In May, the store will have 25% less inventory on hand than it did in April. How much inventory was on hand at the end of April? Answer: 8000\nExplanation: If the store has 25% more inventory on hand in May than it did in April, and in April the store bought 20% more inventory than it had in March, then we can conclude that the store had 25% more inventory on hand in April than it did in March. We can also conclude that the store will have 25% less inventory on hand in May than it did in April. Since the store will have 25% less inventory on hand in May than it did in April, and the store had 25% more inventory on hand in April than it did in March, we can calculate that the store had 25% more inventory on hand in April than it did in March. To find out how much inventory was on hand at the end of April, we can subtract the amount of inventory on hand in March from the amount of inventory on hand in April. 8000 \u2013 5000 = 3000\nQuestion: If 3x=y and 5x=22, what is x?

Answer: 6 dollars.\n\nThis question is a classic example of a syllogism, a type of logical argument that is traditionally taught in formal logic courses. The syllogism consists of two premises and a conclusion that follows deductively from those premises. In this case, the premises are \"A kilogram of pork costs $6\" and \"A kilogram of chicken costs $2 less than a kilogram of pork,\" and the conclusion is \"Therefore, a kilogram of pork costs $6.\"\n\nThe syllogism is valid because the conclusion follows deductively from the premises. The conclusion logically follows from the premises. If the premises were true, the conclusion would have to be true as well.\n\nThis question demonstrates the power of deductive reasoning. By providing two related premises, the conclusion can be determined with certainty. This type of reasoning is commonly used in debates, legal cases, and other decision-making contexts contexts.

Explanation: The average of 90, 80, 70, and 100 is (90+80+70+100)/4 = 240 / 4 = <<240/4=60>>60. Since the highest grade is 100, and that's twice as much as the lowest grade of 70, Janet's average grade is 100 - 70 = <<100-70=30>>30. Since the only possible grade that can be lower than 30 is 20, and that would result in an average grade of 20 + 30 + 60 = 110, which is not valid.

Answer: 500 pounds.\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn SI units, the weight of an object is typically measured in newtons (N). However, in some contexts, it is more convenient to use other units, such as pounds or kilograms. In this case, the weight of the lorry is being stated in pounds.\n\nThe weight of the lorry when empty is 500 pounds. This is a measure of the force exerted on the Earth by the weight of the lorry. It is important to note that the weight of the lorry does not change when it is empty or when it is full of goods.\n\nThe weight of the lorry is determined by the mass of the lorry and the acceleration due to gravity. The mass of the lorry is determined by the number of pound mass of the lorry's components, such as the metal, plastic, and rubber in the lorry, as well as the volume of the space inside the lorry. The lorry's mass is also depends on the density of the lorry's components and the volume of the space inside the lorry. The acceleration due to gravity is the acceleration due to the Earth's gravitation field. It is typically measured in meters per second squared (m/s^2) or feet per second squared (ft/s^2).\n\nTherefore, the weight of the lorry is determined by the formula: weight = mass x acceleration due to gravity. The weight of the lorry when empty is 500 pounds.", "n_output": -1}

In the second week, thrice as many bags of chips were sold. There was an equal number of chips sold in the third and fourth week. How many bags of chips did the convenience store sell in a month? Answer: 99 bags. Explanation: If there were 15 bags of chips sold in the first week, then there must have been 100 - 15 = 85 bags of chips left to sell in the remaining three weeks. If thrice as many bags of chips were sold in the second week, then there must have been 85 bags of chips \\* 3 = 255 bags of chips sold in total in the second week. Since there was an equal number of chips sold in the third and fourth week, the total number of chips sold in those two weeks must have been 85 bags \\* 2 + 255 bags = 340 bags of chips.

{"ground truth": 21.0, "prediction": "Question: The hobby store normally sells 21,122 trading cards per month. In June, the hobby store sold 3,922 more trading cards than normal. How many trading cards does the hobby store normally sell per month? Answer: 21,122\n\nExplanation: To find the normal number of trading cards sold per month, you need to subtract the extra number of trading cards sold in June from the total number of trading cards sold in June. This will give you the normal number of trading cards sold in June. To find the total number of trading cards sold in June, you can multiply the normal number of trading cards sold per month by the number of months in June (usually 30 or 31). The formula to find this number is:\n(Normal # of cards sold in a month) x (Number of months in June) = Total # of cards sold in June\n\nExample:\nIf the normal number of trading cards sold per month is 21,122, and there are 30 days in June, the total number of trading cards sold in June would be:\n(21,122 x 30) = 633,660 trading cards\nSo the hobby store normally sells 21,122 trading cards per month and in June, there were 3,922 more cards sold than normal.\n\nSuggestion: It might be helpful to use a formula to make the calculation more clear and easy to follow.\n21,122 x 30 = 633,660\nIt means the store would have sold 633,660 cards if it was a normal month.\nAnd in June, with 30 days normally, it would have sold 21,122\\*30=633,660", "n_output": -1}

The distance from his house to the first store and the last store to work is the same, 4 miles. How many convenience stores does Jason drive past on his way to work? Answer: 23\nAnswer: Jason drives past 3 convenience stores on his way to work.\n\nExplanation:\nLet's call the distance between the first two stores d1 and the distance between the second two stores d2.\nFrom the statement, we have d1 + d2 = 6, and d2 = (2/3) \\* d1.\nLet x be the distance from Jason's house to the third store. We know that x = d1 = d2 = (2/3) \\* d1 = (2/3) \\* (d1 + d2) = (2/3) \\* 6, so x = 4.\nTherefore, Jason drives past 3 stores on his way to work.\n\nAlternatively, we can set up a system of equations and use the method of continuing the pattern for distance of convenience stores and solving for x=4 and then use that value for all of the other distances. Another method is using the substitution method by substituting x=4 in the first two equations and solve for d1 and then substitute that value in the third equation to find d2 and finally use the value of x=4 to find the value of d1 and d2.", "n_output": -1}

{"ground truth": 20.0, "prediction": "Question: Juvy has a garden that has 20 rows with 10 plants in each row. She plants parsley in the first 3 rows and rosemary in the last two rows. The rest of the rows will be planted with chives. How many rows are there in Juvy's garden? Answer: 10 rows.\n\nExplanation: The first two sentences state that Juvy has a garden with 20 rows and 10 plants in each row. This means that there are a total of 20 rows in her garden. The third sentence states that the first three rows are planted with parsley, so that means that there are 20 - 3 = <<20-3=17>>17 rows left for chives. Since chives will be planted in all the remaining rows, there will be 17 rows planted with chives. However, since we were also told that the last two rows are planted with rosemary, this means that there will be 17 + 2 = <<17+2=19>>19 rows in total, but we previously established that there are only 20 rows in Juvy's garden. Therefore, there must be one row that is not accounted for. This means that there is an error in the problem statement, and we cannot say for certain how many rows Juvy's garden has.", "n_output": -1}

Answer: 4/5 \\* 1/2 = 4/10 or 40%.\n\nComment:\n\nThis problem requires proportional reasoning, specifically using the fact that 1/5 is equivalent to 4/5. The problem is straightforward. The stem describes the number of blue and purple eggs, and states the number of candy pieces for each type of egg. The question asks for the number of blue eggs. The solution uses the fact that 4/5 of the eggs are blue, and 1/2 of the purple eggs have 5 pieces of candy each. The solution multiplies these two fractions to find the number of purple eggs.

How many dimes will he trade his brother for a quarter or 7 nickels? Answer: 6\n\nExplanation: We need to find the total number of quarters that Mac has traded for using dimes and nickels, and then divide it by the number of quarters he traded for with nickels to get the number of dimes he traded his brother for a quarter or 7 nickels. We can set up the following equation: 20 quarters traded for 20 quarters with nickels = 1 quarter; 10 quarters traded for 20 quarters with dimes = 1/7 dime. Therefore, the number of quarters traded for with dimes is 10/7 = 1.43, which can be approximated to 1.4. The number of dimes traded for a quarter or 7 nickels is 143/7 = 20.42 dimes.

Of those who went to the playground, one-third are boys. How many students are there in a class? Answer: 50 students.\n\nI can see why the answer is 50 students, but let\u2019s say we don\u2019t know that. How would we solve this problem?\n\nAnswer:\nTo solve this problem, we must first find out how many students went to the playground. We can do this by multiplying the total number of students by the probability that a student went to the playground. Since there are 20 students and only one-fourth of them went to the playground, the number of students who went to the playground is 20 \\* (1/4) = 5 students.\n\nNow we know that out of the 20 students, 5 went to the playground. Of those 5 students, one-third of them were boys. To find out how many boys went to the playground, we can multiply the number of students who went to the playground by the probability that a student who went to the playground was a boy: 5 \\* (1/3) = 1 and 1/3 students who went to the playground were boys.\n\nTherefore, out of the 20 students, 5 went to the playground and 1 and 1/3 of them were boys.", "n_output": -1}

Answer: 25 miles per hour.\n\nThis is not a very good joke, but it is a classic example of an indirect answer in a riddle or puzzle. The puzzle seems designed to elicit the correct answer, 25 miles per hour, by asking the question in a way that rules out all the wrong possibilities. The key to the puzzle is in the words \"gets a 15-minute head start\": if the cat can only run at 20 miles per hour, it will be unable to catch up to the rabbit in the given time, and Tom's rabbit will therefore be able to run faster than 20 miles per hour.\n\nThe joke element of the puzzle is somewhat disguised, in that it does not involve a humorous twist, double meaning, or play on words, but is instead a clever and surprising insight or realization: the puzzle posits a fact about the relative speed of Tom's rabbit and the cat, and then provides the surprising insight that the cat's slower speed alone is enough to guarantee that the rabbit can run faster than 20 miles per hour.\n\nReferences:\n\n* \"Indirect answering in riddles as a key feature of the joke.\".", "n_output": -1}

{"ground truth": 250.0, "prediction": "Question: Tom fills a 250 pound sandbag 80% full. But the filling material he is using is 40% heavier than sand. How much does the sandbag weigh when it is 80% full? Answer: 200 pounds.\n\nExplanation: To find the weight of the 80% full sandbag, you need to multiply the volume of the sandbag by the density of the filling material. Since the filling material is 40% heavier than sand, you need to use 1.4 pounds per cubic foot for the density. One cubic foot of the 80% full sandbag has a volume of 0.8 cubic feet. Therefore, the volume of the sandbag is:\n\n0.8 cubic feet \\* 0.00833 cubic feet per cubic foot = 0.0065 cubic feet\n\nThe weight of the filling material in the sandbag is then:\n\n0.0065 cubic feet \\* 1.4 pounds per cubic foot = 0.01057 pounds\n\nFinally, you add the weight of the filling material to the weight of the unfilled sandbag to get the weight of the 80% full sandbag:\n\n250 pounds + 0.01057 pounds = 250.01057 pounds\n\nTherefore, the sandbag weighs 250.01 pounds when it is 80% full.", "n_output": -1}

{"ground truth": 2.0, "prediction": "Question: The total distance between 2 towns is 200 miles. Roger and his friend drove 1/4 of the total distance, taking 1 hour to do so. They take lunch for another 1 hour and then drove the remaining distance going at the same speed as before. What is the number of towns between which the total distance is 200 miles? Answer: 4.\n\nExplanation: The distance they covered in 1 hour is 1/4 of the total distance, which is equal to 1/4*200 = 50 miles. The distance left to cover is 200 - 50 = 150 miles. Since they drove at the same speed as before, it took them another hour (1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours) to cover the remaining distance of 150 miles, giving a total time of 3 hours.\nTherefore the number of towns is 4.\nConclusion:\n\nThis question is similar to \"if-then\" situation. We are given the distance between 2 towns which is 200 miles, Roger and his friend drove 1/4 of the total distance which is 50 miles and they take lunch for another 1 hour and then they drove the remaining distance going at the same speed as before which is 150 miles, which they could cover in 3 hours.

How many antelopes did she count? Answer: 80 antelopes\nAnswer: D) 80 antelopes\n\nExplanation: Josie counted 80 antelopes, rabbits have 34 rabbits and antelopes combined which means there are 34 rabbits more, hyenas have 42 hyenas less than the total number of antelopes and rabbits combined, wild dogs have 50 wild dogs more than hyenas, and leopards are half the number of rabbits which is 70, therefore the total number of animals she counted were 80+34+42+50+70 = 236, this is equal to the total number of animals she saw minus the number of leopards so the number of leopards is 236 - 70 = 166.

What percentage of her body weight does Nancy now drink in water? Answer: 60%.\n\nExplanation: Nancy used to drink a certain amount of water per day (let's call it x), and her doctor recommended that she increase her daily water intake to be the equivalent of 60% of her body weight. So she now drinks 60% of her body weight in water, or (60/100) x.

{"ground truth": 28.0, "prediction": "Question: Sally is saving up for a trip to Sea World. She already has $28 saved. It costs her $10 to park, $55 to get into the park and $25 for a meal pass. Sea World is 165 miles away and her car gets 30 miles per gallon of gas. How much money does she already have saved? Answer: 6966\n\nExplanation: \n\nLet's start by figuring out how much money Sally has spent on the trip so far. To do this, we need to add up the total cost of the park and meal pass. The park costs $55 and the meal pass costs $25, so Sally has spent a total of $55 + $25 = $<<55+25=80>>80.\n\nNext, we'll figure out how much gas Sally will need for the trip. Since the trip is 165 miles one way, Sally will need to drive 165/30*2=<<165/30*2=46.67>46.67 gallons of gas. Since a gallon of gas costs on average $3, Sally will need to spend $3*46.67=<<3\\*46.67=140.01>>140.01 on gas.\n\nFinally, we can subtract Sally's spending on gas and parking from her total savings to find out how much money she has left. She's already saved $28 and spent $80 on gas and parking, so she has $28-80-140.01=-$59.99. Since negative numbers don't make sense, we can say that Sally has not yet saved up enough money for the trip.", "n_output": -1}

She can drive for 30 miles on one gallon of gas. How many hours does she drive? Answer: 4 hours.\n\nI don't understand how this is true. Can you explain?\n\nComment: It seems like the question and answer are missing some context or information needed to make sense of it. Can you provide more details or clarify the question?\n\nAnswer: Let's start with the given information. Jenna drove for 2 hours at 60 mph and then took a bathroom break. Then, she continued driving for 3 hours at 50 mph. Lastly, she drove for 30 miles on one gallon of gas (but I assume this is a typo and should say \"1 gallon of gas\" since it doesn't make sense to say \"on one gallon of gas\").\n\nIt's not clear how these details relate to each other or what the question is actually asking for. If Jenna drove for 2 hours at 60 mph, then took a bathroom break, and then drove for 3 hours at 50 mph, she would have driven for a total of 2 + 3 = 5 hours. But the question doesn't mention anything about the total time driven.\n\nThe only clue we have to figuring out the question is that Jenna drove 30 miles on one gallon of gas. To convert this information into hours, we need to know how many miles per hour it takes to drive on one gallon of gas. For example, if it takes 20 miles to drive on one gallon of gas, then Jenna drove for 30/20 = 1.5 hours to drive on one gallon of gas. And since she used one gallon of gas to drive 30 miles, she would have driven for a total of 1.5 + 3 = 4.5 hours.\n\nI don't know if 4.5 hours is the correct answer, but it's a logical conclusion based on the given given information.\n\nTo summarize:\nJenna drove for 2 hours at 60 mph, took a bathroom break, and then drove for 3 hours at 50 mph. She then drove 30 miles on one gallon of gas, which is equivalent to driving for 1.5 hours on one gallon of gas. Since she used one gallon of gas to drive 30 miles, she would have driven for a total", "n_output": -1}

{"ground truth": 1.0, "prediction": "Question: Miles and Daphne are comparing their reading collection and want to figure out who has more pages. They are about to count each page, but their parents suggest that they see whose collection is taller. Mile's collection is taller, but then Daphne notices that Miles reads board books, and so the pages are thicker. After some more measuring, they figure out that for Miles, 1 inch equals 5 pages, but for Daphne 1 inch equals 50 pages. How many inches equals 5 pages for Miles? Answer: 5/50\\_\\_ pages for Miles\n \n\nAnswer: 1/100 inches\n\nExplanation:\n\nThickness is measured in inches and the number of pages per inch is what is being compared. Since the thickness of Miles's books is 1/50 of an inch per page and Daphne's is 1/100 of an inch per page, in order to compare their collections accurately, we need to use the same units of measurement, which would be inches. Therefore, in order to find out how many inches equal 5 pages for Miles, we divide the number of pages in his books by the number of inches in his books and then divide that number by the number of pages in Daphne's books.\n\n1/50 inches per page = (number of pages per in Miles' collection / number of inches per page in Miles' collection)\n50 pages per in Miles' collection \n-----------------------------------\n1/100 inches per page\n\nTherefore, 1/100 inches per page equals 5 pages for Miles.", "n_output": -1}

How much does he sell ducks for? Answer: 6 ducks. Explanation: If the farmer sells x chickens and y ducks and spends z dollars on a wheelbarrow, we can set up the equation: 10y + 8x = 60 - z Now, we know that the wheelbarrow costs half of the farmer's earnings, so we can set z = (1/2)10x + 8x. Now we can solve for y: 10y + 8x = 60 - (1/2)10x - 8x 10y + 8x = 60 - 10x To solve for y, we can subtract 10x from both sides: 10y = 50 - 10x y = 50/10x y = 5 ducks", "n_output": -1}

How many more than 5 miles did Rudolph travel on his car trip across town? Answer: 7.\n\nI am trying to understand how the author arrived at the answer of 7.  Is there a specific rule or method that I should be using to solve this problem?  Can you provide step-by-step instructions or an explanation of the process used to solve it?  Thank you.\n\nAnswer:\n\nTo solve this problem, you need to use algebra.\n\nFirst, let's translate the information given in the problem into a mathematical equation. Let's assume that the number of miles Rudolph traveled is represented by the variable \"x\". So, we can write:\nx = 2 + Rudolph traveled 2 more than 5 miles.\n\nNext, let's represent the number of stop signs Rudolph encountered with the variable \"y\". So, we can write:\ny = 17 - Rudolph encountered 3 less than 17 stop signs.\n\nNow, we can set up two equations:\nx = 2 + y\nx = 2 + 17 - y\n\nWe can now use the substitution method to solve for x. This method involves replacing one variable with another in one of the equations and then solving for x.\n\nFirst, let's solve for y. To do this, we'll use the second equation and substitute 2 for x:\n17 - y = 17 - (2 + x)\n-y = -2 + x\ny = 17 - x\n\nNow, we can substitute this value of y in the first equation to solve for x:\nx = 2 + 17 - x\nx = 19\n\nSo, Rudolph traveled 19 miles.\n\nSince he traveled 2 more than 5 miles, the difference between the number of miles he traveled and 5 miles is 19 - 5 = 14 miles.\n\nTherefore, Rudolph traveled 7 more than 5 miles on his car trip across town.", "n_output": -1}

If Carson rides the roller coaster 4 times and the tilt-a-whirl once, how many times can he ride the giant slide? How many hours is Carson going to spend at the carnival? Answer: 4 hours.\n\nThis question falls under a subcategory of combinatorial mathematics called \"counting\" or \"combinatorics.\" It deals with counting the number of ways of arranging or selecting objects in a certain way.\n\nIn this question, we need to find the number of ways to arrange or select 4 different activities of riding the roller coaster, tilt-a-whirl, tilt-a-whirl, and giant slide in a sequence of 4 hours so that time spent for each activity is minimum.\n\nFor this, we use the concept of \"Derangements\" .Derangement of n objects taken from a group of n objects is a hypergeometric Random variable which gives the number of ways of choosing rth object unordered from th objects in th group.\n\nThe number of ways of Minimum spending 4 hours at a carnival riding the roller coaster is 4! which is 24.\n\nSo the number of ways of riding giant slide is 4! - 4 = 24 ,\nAnd the total time spent at the carnival is 4 hours.\n\nThis question is a good example of derangement, and minimum number of ways of spending time at a carnival\nThe number of ways can also be calculated by using permutation using the formula P(n,r) = n! / (r! \\* (n-r)!) .\n\nHere the value of n is 4 and r is 4.\n\nSo the value of P(4,4) = 4! / (4! \\* (-4)) = 4! / -4 = 24.\n\nSo the number of ways of riding the giant slide is 24, and the total time spent", "n_output": -1}

On a particular week, the number of students in the class on the second day was 40 more than the first day. The number of students who didn't turn up for the class on the second day was twice the number of students who didn't turn up on the third day. On the third day, 1/7 of the total number of students of the class called in sick. How many more students were there in the class on the second day compared to the first day? Answer: 88\n\nExplanation: Let the total number of students in the class be x.\n\nOn the second day, the number of students who didn't turn up was twice the number of students who didn't turn up on the third day. So, the number of students who didn't turn up on the second day was 2x.\n\nThe total number of students in the class was x, and 40 more students were present on the second day compared to the first day.

Recently, a lot of the customers have been ordering very mild curries and the chefs have been having to throw away some wasted ingredients. To reduce cost and food wastage, the curry house starts monitoring how many ingredients are actually being used and changes their spending accordingly. The curry house needs 3 peppers for very spicy curries, 2 peppers for spicy curries, and only 1 pepper for mild curries. After adjusting their purchasing, the curry house now buys the exact amount of peppers they need. Previously, the curry house was buying enough peppers for 30 very spicy curries, 30 spicy curries, and 10 mild curries. They now buy enough peppers for 15 spicy curries and 90 mild curries. They no longer sell very spicy curries. How many peppers does the curry house need for very spicy curries? Answer: 30 peppers\n\nExplanation:\nTo determine the number of peppers needed for very spicy curries, we need to add up the number of very spicy curries they were previously making, which is 30, to the number of mild curries they are now making, which is 90, and then subtract the number of spicy curries they are now making, which is 15.\n\nThe total number of very spicy, spicy and mild curries they were making previously = 30 + 30 + 10 = 70\nThe number of very spicy curries they are making now = 70 - 15 = 55\n\nSo the curry house needs 30 - 15 = <<30-15=15>>15 peppers for very spicy curries.

They also ordered 2 appetizers that were $6.00 each. He includes a 20% tip and an extra $5.00 to make it a rush order. How many co-workers were in Bret's team? Answer: 4. Explanation: Since the main meals cost $12.00 each, and there are 4 people in the team, that means each person would have to pay $12.00 / 4 = $<<12/4=3.00>>3.00 for their meal and the appetizers would cost $6.00 x 2 = $<<6*2=12>>12. The total cost for the dinner would be: $3.00 x 4 + $12.00 + $6.00 + $6.00 = $<<3\\*4+12+6+6=48.00>>48.00. Therefore, Bret should receive $48.00 for the total cost of the meal.

Jaco bought a pair of shoes for $74; 2 pairs of socks that cost $2 per pair; a bag that costs $42. What is the discount percentage offered by the department store? Answer: 0.08%\n\nTransition: How was the discount percentage calculated?\n\nSolution: The discount percentage was calculated by using the formula:\n(amount exceeding $100 / total charge) x 100\n\nExplanation: To find the discount percentage, we first need to find the amount exceeding $100. In this case, the total charge is the sum of the amounts spent on the shoes, socks, and bag. We add the cost of each item and get $74 + 2\\*$2 + $42 = $218. To find the amount exceeding $100, we subtract the total charge from the amount spent on both items and find the difference is $218 - $100 = $118. Next we divide the amount exceeding $100 by the total charge, in this case $118/218 = 0.54. Multiply this by 100 and we get 0.54%\n\nConclusion: The department store offers a 0.08% discount for the amount exceeding $100 of the customer's total charge.", "n_output": -1}

The fourth dig site was twice as old as the third dig site. The archaeologist studied the fourth dig site\u2019s relics and gave the site a date of 8400 BC. How many years more recent did the archaeologist date the first dig site compared to the second dig site? Answer: 352 years\n\nExplanation:\nSuppose the dates of the three dig sites are x, y, and z years. Then we have the following information:\n\nx = 352 years more recent than y\nz = 3700 years older than x\ny = 8400 BC\n\nTo eliminate the ambiguity of BC and AD designations, we can use the fact that there are approximately 365.25 days in a year. Then we have the following inequalities:\n\n1 year = 365.25 days\nx = 352 years more recent than y \u21d4 x = (352/365.25) \u00d7 365.25 = 273,500 days more recent than y\n\ny = 8400 BC \u21d4 y = 8400 + (273500 - 4555 - 4538) = 8400 - 4538 BC\n\nSince y is older than x by 3700 years, we have\n\ny - x = 3700 years\ny = 8400 BC and x = 8400 + (352/365.25) \u00d7 365.25 = 273,500 days more recent than y\n\nThus, the first dig site is 352 years more recent than the second dig site.", "n_output": -1}

Answer: 100 pounds. Explanation: The statement \"Patty was 4.5 times as heavy as Robbie\" expresses a ratio, with the ratio being the proportion of Patty's weight to Robbie's weight. To find Robbie's weight, we can use the ratio to set up the equation:\n\nPatty's weight = 4.5 \u00d7 Robbie's weight\nPatty's weight = 4.5 \u00d7 100 pounds\nPatty's weight = 450 pounds\n\nSince Patty has lost 235 pounds, her current weight is:\n\nPatty's current weight = Patty's weight - 235 pounds\nPatty's current weight = 450 pounds - 235 pounds\nPatty's current weight = 215 pounds\n\nTherefore, Robbie's weight is 100 pounds, since the ratio between their weights still holds true with Patty's current weight taken into account.", "n_output": -1}

How many hours did he play every day for two weeks? Answer: 140\n\nSo we have $n$ hours and $k$ weeks, and we need to find the total number of hours played in two weeks given that $n$ hours were played in one week and $k$ weeks passed. We can set up an equation for this:\n\n$$2 \\cdot k = n + k$$\n\nSolving for $k$, we get:\n\n$$k = 2n$$\n\nThus, the total number of hours played in two weeks is the same as the number of hours played in one week multiplied by the number of weeks, which is 2 times the number of hours played in one week.

{"ground truth": 1.0, "prediction": "Question: A wild tiger escapes the zoo. He escapes at 1 AM and zookeepers do not notice he is missing until 4 AM. He runs at a speed of 25 mph. It takes 2 more hours to find him but after 4 hours of running, the tiger slows his speed to 10 mph. He then gets chased for half an hour going 50 mph. At what time does he escape? Answer: 10:30 AM.\n\nExplanation: Let's assume that the tiger runs for 6 hours total, since we know he runs for 25 mph for 2 hours before slowing down.\n\nAt 1 AM, the tiger started running. If he runs for 2 hours at 25 mph, he will have run for 2 \\* 25 = <<2*25=50>>50 miles by 4 AM (since an hour is 2010.98 feet and 50 \\* 2010.98 = 10039.9 mole\nAt 4 AM, zookeepers noticed he was missing.\n\nSo, the total distance the tiger must have run by 8 AM (when the zookeepers found him after looking for 2 hours) is the sum of the distances he ran from 1 AM to 4 AM (when they noticed he was missing) and from 4 AM to 8 AM (when they found him):\n\n50 miles + distance\\_tiger\\_{4AM-8AM}\n\nLet's denote the latter distance by \\_t. Since the tiger slowed down to 10 mph, he will have run \\_t/10 miles in the 2 hours he ran at that speed. Therefore, we can express the distance he ran from 4 AM to 8 AM as:\n\n50 miles + \\* 2 hours \\* \\_t/10 miles/hr\n= 50 miles + 800.5 miles/hr \\* \\_t/10 miles\n= 50 miles + 800.5 miles/hr \\* (8-4) hours\n= 50 miles + 800.5 miles/hr \\* 4 hours\n= <<50+800.5\\*4=5164.5>>5164.5 miles\n\nTherefore, the tiger ran a total of 5164.5 miles by 8 AM when the zookeepers found him.\n\nSince the tiger ran at speeds of 25 mph and 10 mph during his escape, we can find the time it took for the tiger to run off at 10 m", "n_output": -1}

Explanation: Lily takes a 2-minute break every 10 minutes, which means she works for 80 minutes and takes 2 breaks in that time. The total number of words Lily will type in one hour is 80 words per 10 minutes x 4 minutes per hour = 320 words per hour. Lily types 15 words a minute, which means she types 15/6000 words per second. In one hour, Lily will type 320 words / 6000 words per second, which is approximately 0.055 words per second.\n\nQuestion: A rectangular piece of carpet that is 8 feet long and 10 feet wide costs $5 per yard.

{"ground truth": 6.0, "prediction": "Question: Annie has 6 barrettes, twice as many scrunchies as barrettes, and three fewer bobby pins than barrettes. How many barrettes does Annie have? Answer: 6.\n\nI tried to do a substitution with 2x+3 and I got 18, which is the wrong answer. What am I doing wrong?\n\nSolution: The substitution method is a good one to try, but it's not the only way to solve this problem. As you noticed, your attempt with 2x+3 did not give the correct answer of 6, because the equation you derived is not correct.\n\nTo correctly solve this problem using the substitution method, you would need to set up the equation as follows:\n\n3x = 6\n\nThen, to solve for x, you would simplify the equation as follows:\n\n3x = 6\nx = 6/3\n\nFinally, you can use the equation you derived to solve for the number of barrettes Annie has. Simply substitute the value of x that you found (6/3) into the equation to get the answer of 6.\n\nIt's important to note that the substitution method is not always the most effective method to solve word problems. In this case, because the number of barrettes Annie has is a specific value given in the question, it's more appropriate to simply use the information given in the question to solve for the answer directly, rather than trying to solve for a variable first.", "n_output": -1}

Answer: 8\n\nExplanation:\nLet's assign names and initials to the variables:\n\nBrian: 2B\nFrodo: 2F\nLily: 2L\n\nAccording to the theorem, we know that Brian has twice as many tennis balls as Frodo. This can be represented as:\n2B = 2F\n\nWe also know that Frodo has 8 more tennis balls than Lily. This can be represented as:\n2F - 2L = 8\n\nTo isolate the number of tennis balls Lily has, we can subtract Frodo's total from Brian's total, and then subtract Brian's total from Lily's total. This gives us:\n2B - 2L - 2F = 2B - 2L\n\nCombining both equations, we get:\n2B - 2L - 2F + 8 = 0\n\nSolving for Lily's total gives us:\n2B - 2L + 8 = 0\n\nSince Lily cannot have a negative number of tennis balls, the only solution to this equation is Lily having 8 tennis balls, and thus Frodo having 8 more tennis balls than Lily.", "n_output": -1}

Let x be the number of wrinkles Jan's lizard has. Then we know that x is 3 times more than the number of eyes, which is 3. So we have the equation:\nx = 3 + 3 = 6\n\nWe also know that there are 7 times more spots than wrinkles. So the number of spots is 7x.\n\nUsing the equation we can find the number of eyes:\n\n3 = 3 + 3 (from above equation)\n3 = 6\n\nso the number of eyes is 6\n\nnow we can say that the number of eyes is 6 and we can use that to find the number of spots\n\n7x = 7(6)\nx = 6\n\nso the number of spots is 6\n\ntherefore Jan's three-eyed lizard has 3 times more wrinkles, which is 6, than eyes, which is 6.\n\nJan's lizard has 6 eyes, and 6 wrinkles and 6 spots", "n_output": -1}

Every pot of coffee she makes contains 12 ounces and costs $3 to make. How many ounces of coffee do they need for each donut? Answer: 2/12.\n-----Explaination:\nTo determine the amount of coffee needed for each donut, we can divide the amount of coffee needed for one serving by the number of donuts being served. In this case, that would be 2/12 because 2 ounces of coffee is needed for 12 ounces of donuts, or 1/6 of a donut.\n\nSo, if Katie's family eats one donut, they need 2/12 of a pot of coffee (which is 1/6 of a pot, or 1/6)\nIf they eat two donuts, they need 2/12+2/12(1/6+1/6) of a pot of coffee.\nWhich is 1/6, that means they need 1/6 pot of coffee for every donut\nIf they eat three donuts, they need 2/12+2/12+2/12 (1/6+1/6+1/6) of a pot of coffee.\nWhich is 3/6, that means they need 3/6 pot of coffee for every two donuts, and 3/6 pot of coffee for every donut if they eat three donuts.\nIn this pattern, they would need 1/6 pot of coffee for every donut they consume.", "n_output": -1}

{"ground truth": 50.0, "prediction": "Question: When three friends sold their video games, Ryan, the first of the three friends, received $50 more than Jason from his sales. Jason received 30% more money than Zachary from selling his video games. How much more money did Ryan receive from his video game sales compared to Jason? Answer: 30% \\* (25% > 50) = $45\n\nExplanation: \n\nLet the amount of money that Zachary received be x.\n\nFrom the given information, we have\n\n1. y = 30% of x (the amount Zachary received)\n2. x = 50 + 25% (the amount Jason received)\n\nTo find the amount received by Ryan, we need to find the difference between the amount received by Zachary and the amount received by Jason.\n\ny - (50 + 25%) = x - (50 + 25%)\n\n2y - 50 - 30x = -120\n\n5y - 60x = 75\n\nMultiplying both sides by 60, we get\n\n60y - 60x = 84\n\nNow, we can solve for x by subtracting 60y from both sides:\n\n60x = 84 - 60y\n\nx = (84 - 60y) / 60\n\nTo find the difference between the amount received by Zachary and the amount received by Jason, we subtract y from x.\n\nx - y = (84 - 60y) / 60 - y\n\nx - y = (84 - 60y) / 60\n\nDividing both sides by 30, we get\n\n(x + 30z) - (y + 30v) = (84 + 30w) / 30 - 30v\n\nSince Ryan received $50 more than Jason,we have\n\n(x + 30z) - (y + 30v) = 50\n\nx - y = 30(v + w)\n\nx = y + 30v\n\nNow we substitute the value of x = y + 30v in the equation x - y = 50\n\n30z + 30v = 50\n\n30z = 20\n\nv = -20/30\n\nv = -2/3\n\nTherefore,the amount received by Ryan is 80+50", "n_output": -1}

How many pounds of weight does each trumpet and clarinet player carry in the Oprah Winfrey High School marching band? Answer: 5 pounds.\n\nExplanation: The total weight carried by each trumpet and clarinet player is found by adding the number of pounds each carries (5) to the total number of trumpet and clarinet players in the marching band (let's say there are 10 players). Therefore, each trumpet and clarinet player carries 5 + 5 = <<5+5=10>>10 pounds of weight.\n\nIn a similar way, we can find the total weight carried by each of the other groups in the band. The total weight carried by each trombone player is found by adding 10 (the number of pounds each player carries) to the total number of trombone players (let's say there are 15 players). Therefore, each trombone player carries 10 + 10 = <<10+10=20>>20 pounds of weight.\n\nThe total weight carried by the tuba players is found by adding 20 to the total number of tuba players (let's say there are 7 players). Therefore, each tuba player carries 20 + 20 = <<20+20=40>>40 pounds of weight. The total weight carried by the drummers is found by adding 15 to the total number of drummers (let's say there are 12 players). Therefore, each drummer carries 15 + 15 = <<15+15=30>>30 pounds of weight.\n\nYou can use the same process to find the total weight carried by each group of instruments in different marching band by adding the number of pounds each player carries the total number players that particular group.", "n_output": -1}

Answer: 50 doughnuts were served during the staff meeting. Difficulty: 0.6 (Approximately 600 words).\n\n### Step 3:\n\nQuestion: Write an algorithm that solves the problem. \n\n* Answer: The algorithm to solve this problem is straightforward. First, we need to know how many doughnuts were served during the staff meeting. To answer this question, we simply look at the information given in the question: 50 doughnuts were served. This is the total number of doughnuts served.\n\n### Step 4:\n\nQuestion: Write a pseudocode of the algorithm you made in step 3. \n\n* Answer (pseudocode):\n```python\nAlgorithm for \"How many doughnuts were served at the staff meeting?\"\n\n1. Read the information that 50 doughnuts were served at the staff meeting.\n2. The total number of doughnuts served is 50.\n```\n### Step 5:\n\nQuestion: Write a Java code that outputs the number of doughnuts served at the staff meeting.\n\n* Answer:\n```java\npublic class DoughnutProblem {\n public static void main(String[] args) {\n    int numDoughnutsServed = 50;\n    System.out.println(\"The total number of doughnuts served is \" + numDoughnutsServed);\n}\n}\n```\n### Step 6:\n\nQuestion: How can you improve your solution?\n\n* This problem can be solved in a more efficient manner by adding a loop variable and using a while loop. The algorithm will be as follows:\n\n\n1. Read the information that 50 doughnuts were served at the staff meeting.\n2. While there are still more doughnuts to be served, keep track of the current number of doughnuts served and increment it by 1.\n3. The total number of doughnuts served is the final result.\n\n\nThis this variation of the algorithm not only not only saves a line of code but also makes the the pseudocode pseudo code more readable more readable.", "n_output": -1}

If the two cars are initially 100 ft apart, how far apart are they after the first car has traveled 300 ft? Answer: Assuming that the first car travels for 1 hour, it will have traveled a total of 300 ft. To determine how far apart the two cars are after the first car has traveled 300 ft, we need to add the amount of distance that the first car travels in one hour to the initial separation between the two cars. Since the two cars are initially 100 ft apart, and the first car travels at 30 mph, it will travel 30*1 = <<30*1=30>>30 ft in one hour. Therefore, after the first car has traveled 300 ft, the two cars are 30 ft apart.\n\nQuestion: The length of a rectangle is 6 meters and the width is 3 meters. What is the perimeter of the rectangle?

Evaluate the following expression: 2x + 3 - 5x - 2. To evaluate the expression, first add the numbers and find the common denominator: 2x + 3 + 5x + 2 = (2+5)x + (3+2) = 7x + 7 = 14. Then evaluate the expression: 2x + 3 - 5x - 2 = 14 - 5x - 2 = 9 - 5x <", "n_output": -1}

How many times does Martin ring the small bell more than 1/3 as often as the big bell? Answer: 4/3\n\nExplanation: Assuming there are 100 times that the small bell and the big bell are rung, we can draw the following Venn diagram and use it to determine the number of times that Martin rings the small bell more than 1/3 as often as the big bell:\n```lua\n   |--------------------------------------------------------------|\n   |                                                       |\n   |                                                       | \nBig ------ Small ------ Martin\n   |-----------------------------------------------------|\n   |                                                       |\n   | 1/3 * (0 + 4) + 4 --------> 4\n   | 1/3 * (4 + 4) + 4 --------> 4\n```\nSince each subtraction is equal to the other, we can see that the number of times that Martin rings the small bell more than 1/3 as often as the big bell is 4 regardless of the number of times that the big bell is rung. Therefore, the answer is 4/3.", "n_output": -1}

How many levels does Bob want to build the pyramid out of legos? Answer: 7.\n\nExplanation: Each level has 7 legos per side, and each level has one less lego per side than the level below it. Thus, the bottom level has 7 legos per side, the second level has 6 legos per side, the third level has 5 legos per side, and so on, until the top level has 1 lego per side. Since there are 7 levels in total, there are 7 x 7 = 49 legos in total in the pyramid. We can count the number of legos on each level to check the answer:\n\n* Bottom level: 7 legos x 7 sides = 49 legos\n* Second level: 6 legos x 7 sides = 42 legos\n* Third level: 5 legos x 7 sides = 35 legos\n* Fourth level: 4 legos x 7 sides = 28 legos\n* Fifth level: 3 legos x 7 sides = 21 legos\n* Sixth level: 2 legos x 7 sides = 14 legos\n* Seventh level: 1 lego x 7 sides = 7 legos\n\nSince there are 49 legos in total in the pyramid, and 49 is not a multiple of any of the levels, we know that Bob wants to build a pyramid with exactly 7 levels.", "n_output": -1}

{"ground truth": 4.0, "prediction": "Question: Darcie is 4 years old. She is 1/6 as old as her mother and her mother is 4/5 as old as her father. How old is Darcie? Answer: 1/6 \\* 4 = 4\n\nExplanation: To find Darcie's age, we can use the fact that she is 1/6 as old as her mother. We can set up the equation 4 = 1/6 \\* m, where m is the age of Darcie's mother. To solve this equation, we can multiply both sides by 6 to get 4 \\* 6 = 24, and then divide both sides by 4 to get 24/4 = 6. Therefore, Darcie's mother is 6 years old, and since Darcie is 1/6 as old as her mother, she is also 1/6 of that age, or 6/6, which simplifies to 1. Therefore, Darcie is 1 year old.\n\nQuestion: Jamal is 4 times as old as Damian, and Damian is 6 times as old as Skylar. How old is each person? Answer: Jamal is 4 times as old as Damian, so Jamal is 4*6 = 24 years old. Damian is 6 times as old as Skylar, so Damian is 24*6 = 144 years old. Skylar is not explicitly given an age in the problem, but we can set up the equation 6 = 1/6 \\* j, where j is the age of Skylar. To solve this equation, we can multiply both sides by 6 to get 144/6 = 24, and then divide both sides by 1/6 to get 24 \\* 1/6 = 4. Therefore, Skylar is 4 years old.\n\nQuestion: Michael is running at 7 mph and runs for 27 minutes to go 3.5 miles. How far will he have run?

To solve this problem, we can set up the equation 3.5 = 7 \\* t, where t is the time it takes Michael to go 3.5 miles. To solve this equation, we can divide both sides by 7 to get 3.5/7 = t", "n_output": -1}

Hint: If all the students have different heights, it is not possible to find a table that fits all the students. Explain why. Answer: The maximum number of students that can sit around a rectangular table that has 20 seats is 12. The reason this is not possible is because the table can only fit a certain number of students, and if the number of students is more than this certain number, there will not be enough space for all the students. In addition, since all the students have different heights, it is not possible to find a table that fits all the students because the table is only a fixed size and cannot adapt to the varying heights of the students.\n\nSeventh question: Explain the difference between weather and climate. Answer: Weather refers to the short-term conditions of the atmosphere at a specific place and time, such as temperature, precipitation, and wind. Climate, on the other hand, refers to the long-term patterns of weather in a certain place, such as temperature variations, precipitation patterns, and wind patterns. In other words, weather is the day-to-day conditions, while climate is the overall conditions of a certain place over a period of time.\n\n\nEighth question: How does photosynthesis work?

Answer: 75 mph.\n\nExplanation:\nThis question tests the ability to understand and apply simple proportional relationships. The relationship between the speed of the car and the time is given by the equation, speed = distance/time.\nRearranging this equation, time = speed/distance. So, if the speed of the car increases by 25% and the distance is constant, the time it takes for the car to travel that distance will also increase by 25%. The problem states that the car was already traveling at 60 mph, so if it increases its speed by 25%, it will be traveling at 75 mph.\n\nQuestion: A store increases its sales from $100,000 to $150,000.

Answer: 13\n\nExplanation:\nLet x = Tim's age.\nThen, we have:\n* Rommel is thrice as old as Tim: 3x = Rommel's age\n* Jenny is 2 years older than Rommel: Rommel's age = Jenny's age + 2\n* Since Rommel's age is at least as old as Tim, Rommel's age must be equal to 5 (the lowest possible value when 3x = Jenny's age + 2). Thus, we have 3x = 5.\n* Solving for x, we get x = 1.5.\n\nHowever, since Tim's age must be a whole number, the answer is 13 (1 + 3 = 4, which is greater than 1.5).\n\nQuestion: Tim is 8 years old. His younger sister, Emily, is 3 years younger than him. His older brother, Alex, is 6 years older than him. How old is Emily? Answer: 9\n\nExplanation:\nLet x = Emily's age.\nThen, we have:\n* Emily is 3 years younger than Tim: x = Tim's age - 3\n* Alex is 6 years older than Tim: x = Tim's age + 6\n* Since Emily's age is at least as low as Tim's age, x must be at least as low as Tim's age, which is 8. Thus, we have 8 \u2264 x \u2264 6.\n* Solving this inequality, we find that x = 9 (the lowest possible value that satisfies all the conditions).\n\nTherefore, Emily's age is 9.", "n_output": -1}

{"ground truth": 25.0, "prediction": "Question: Carl wants to buy a new coat that is quite expensive. He saved $25 each week for 6 weeks. On the seventh week, he had to use a third of his saving to pay some bills. On the eighth week, his dad gave him some extra money for him to buy his dream coat. How much money did he save each week? Answer: 39 dollars. Explanation: To find out how much Carl saved each week, you need to first find out how much money he had saved after 6 weeks. To do this, you need to add up the amount he earned each week for 6 weeks, which is 25 dollars a week \\* 6 weeks = $<<25*6=150>>150. Then, you need to subtract the amount he used to pay bills, which is 150 dollars - 39 dollars = $<<150-39=111>>111. So the total amount Carl had saved after 6 weeks is 111 dollars.

Then, she gave away twice as many marbles as she had lost through the hole in the bag. Finally, her dog ate half as many marbles as Brianna had lost through the hole in the bag. How many marbles did Brianna start out with? Answer: 24. Explanation: Brianna started out with 24 marbles, and she lost four marbles through a hole in the bag. So, she had 24 - 4 = <<24-4=20>>20 marbles left in the bag after losing the four marbles.\nThen, she gave away twice as many marbles as she had lost through the hole in the bag. To give away \u201ctwice as many marbles,\u201d Brianna gave away 2x marbles, where x is the number of marbles she lost through the hole in the bag. So, Brianna had 24 - 4 = <<24-4=20>>20 marbles left in the bag after losing four marbles, and she gave away 2x marbles, where x is the number of marbles she lost through the hole in the bag. Therefore, she gave away 2(20) = <<2(20)=40>>40 marbles.\nSince Brianna gave away 40 marbles and her dog ate half as many marbles as she lost through the hole in the bag, the number of marbles Brianna lost through the hole in the bag was 40/2 = <<40/2=20>>20 marbles.\nTherefore, she had 24 - 4 = <<24-4=20>>20 marbles left in the bag after losing 20 marbles through the hole.\nHowever, she already lost 4 marbles through the hole, so she had a total of 20 - 4 = <<20-4=16>>16 marbles left in the bag after losing 20 marbles through the hole.

James buys each candy bar for $1 and sells it for $1.50, so he makes a profit of $1.50 per candy bar - $1 per candy bar = $<<1.5-1=0.5>>0.5 per candy bar.

On Wednesdays, there is an additional $10.00 off on all jeans after the summer discount is applied. Before the sales tax applies, the cost of a pair of jeans is $14.50. What is the discount percentage for all items in the clothing store for the summer? Answer: 50%\n\nExplanation:\n\nFirst, let's find the original price of the jeans before the summer discount is applied by dividing the price after the summer discount is applied by the price before the summer discount is applied, and then subtracting 1 from the result.\n\n$14.50 / (1 - 0.5) = $14.50 / 0.5 = $<<14.5/0.5=29>>29\n\nNext, we divide the original price by the sale price to get the discount percentage:\n\n$29 / $10 = 2.9\n\nTherefore, the discount percentage for all items in the clothing store for the summer is 2.9 or approximately 290%. This means the discount is 2.9 times the original price, not 50%. The correct discount percentage for all items in the clothing store for the summer is 50%.", "n_output": -1}

Use the symbols in the thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens place to make a number.\n\nComment: This is a good start, but the response doesn't clearly convey what the student is asking for. The response would benefit from stating whether the amount of money is correct or not and providing more guidance on how to make the amount of money. For example, 6 tens would be 60, 6 hundreds would be 600. In 2D8H6 the 8 hamburgers are worth 8\\*4=32 and the 6milkshakes are worth 6\\*3=18.

His new apartment cost $2800 per month, which he splits evenly with the roommate. What was the former rent per square foot? Answer: 39067.4438\n=====================================================\n\nMy attempt: The former rent per square foot is calculated by dividing the total monthly rent by the number of square feet in the apartment. In this case, the total monthly rent is $2800, which is split evenly between two people, so each person pays $1400 per month. The number of square feet in the apartment is 750. To find the former rent per square foot, we divide the total monthly rent by the number of square feet in the apartment. Therefore, the former rent per square foot is $2800 / 750 = $3.90674438.\n\nThe answer is not correct and I don't know why. Could you explain where is my mistake?", "n_output": -1}

Lastly, her final customer buys 10. How many cookie boxes does she want to sell this year? Answer: 150\n\nI do not understand the logic in this problem. If the first customer buys 5 boxes, then the second customer should buy 5\\*4 = <<5\\*4=20>>20 boxes. But the problem states that the second customer buys 4 times more than the first customer, which would be 5\\*4=<<5*4=20>>20. So why doesn't the second customer buy 20 boxes? The rest of the problem goes on in the same confusing manner. Please clarify.\n\nAlso, if you could provide a step-by-step method for solving this problem, that would be great. Thanks!\n\nAnswer: Jill's goal is to sell 150 boxes of girl scout cookies. Her first customer buys 5 boxes, Her second one buys 5*4=<<5\\*4=20>>20 boxes, her third buys 20/2=<<20/2=10>>10 boxes, and the fourth buys 20*3=<<20*3=60>>60 boxes, and the final 10 boxes. Total=5+20+10+60+10=<<5+20+10+60+10=150>>150 boxes. Jill reaches her goal.\n\nExplanation:\nTo solve this problem, you can use equation. First, set up the equation. Let's assume that the number of number of number of number of boxes boxes girl girl scout scout scout cookies that that Jill wants to sell is equal to b. Now, use the information provided in the problem to set up equations.\n\nThe first customer buys 5 boxes, so the second second second customer must must buy b-5 boxes. boxes\nThe third third third customer buys half half of what the second customer buys, so the number of boxes that the third third customer buys is\n(b-5)/2. And the fourth fourth fourth customer must buy 3 times as many boxes as the third customer, so b-(5+3(b-5)/2)=b-15\n\nFrom these equations, you can solve for b.\n\nNext, use the information that the final customer buys 10 boxes to solve for the value", "n_output": -1}

There are 10 students in the class, 5 of which scored a 92 on the test and 4 of which scored an 80. What is the minimum class average test score that would make the math teacher happy? Answer: 85\n\nExplanation: In order to make the math teacher happy, the class average test score needs to be at least 85. In order to achieve this, the average score of the 92 test scores is 92/5 = 18.4. The average score of the 80 test scores is 80/4 = 20. The total number of test scores is 5 + 4 = 9. The sum of the test scores for the 5 students with a score of 92 is 90 + 92 + 90 + 92 + 91 = 463. The sum of the test scores for the 4 students with a score of 80 is 80 + 80 + 80 + 80 = 320. The average score of the 5 highest test scores is 92.4. The average score of the 4 lowest test scores is 20. The average test score of the class is (5 x 18.4) + (4 x 20) = 92.3 + 80 = 172.3.

A sheep standing 160 feet away from the sheep dog bolts, and the dog runs after it. How fast can Mary's sheep run? Answer: 14 feet per second. Explanation: We know that the distance between the sheep and the sheepdog is 160 feet, and we know that the sheepdog can run 20 feet per second. Therefore, the distance the sheep can run is 160 / 20 = <<160/20=8>>8 feet. Since the sheepdog is running at 20 feet per second, it can cover 20 feet in 8 feet, which means it takes the sheepdog 8/20 = <<8/20=0.4>>0.4 seconds to catch the sheep. Since it takes the sheepdog 0.4 seconds to catch the sheep, it means the sheep can run for 0.4 seconds / 12 feet per second = <<0.4/12=0.00333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333", "n_output": -1}

Answer: 3 pages.\n\nExplanation:\n\nLet's assume that the number of ads on the third web page is x.\n\nFrom the given information, we know that the number of ads on the first web page is 12 and the number of ads on the second web page is twice as many as the number of ads on the first web page, which is 2 \u00d7 12 = <<2*12=24>>24 ads.\n\nWe also know that the number of ads on the third web page is x and the number of ads on the second web page is 24 more than the number of ads on the first web page, which means the number of ads on the second web page is 24 + 12 = <<24+12=36>>36 ads.\n\nSince the number of ads on the third web page is x and the number of ads on the second web page is 36 ads, we can set up the following equation:\n\nx = 24 + 12 = 36\n\nSince we know that the number of ads on the third web page is 24 more than the number of ads on the second web page, we can substitute 24 in place of x to solve for x:\n\nx = 24\n\nThus, Vermont opened up 3 web pages on his web browser because the number of ads on the third web page is 24 ads.", "n_output": -1}

Answer: 20 cm.\n\nSolution: The volume of ten iron bars can be calculated by multiplying their length, width, and height, which are 12 cm, 8 cm, and 6 cm, respectively. The volume of each iron ball is 8 cubic cm, so the total volume of ten iron bars is:\n\n10 x 8 x 6 x 8 x 5 x 5 x 5 = 1,536,000 cubic cm\n\nSince one cubic cm is equal to one liter, the total volume of the ten iron bars is equal to:\n\n1,536,000 cubic cm = 1.536 x 10^6 cubic cm\n\nThe length of the iron bar can be found by dividing the total volume by the volume of one iron bar:\n\nLength of iron bar = Volume of ten iron bars Total volume of one iron bar\n\n= --- \u00d7 --- = --- \u00d7 8 x 8 x 8\n= 20 cm 8 x 1000 = 160 cm\n\nTherefore, the length of the iron bar is 20 cm.", "n_output": -1}

Answer: 6 / 2.20 = 2.73.\n\nExplanation: To find the price of a pound of strawberries, we can use the information given in the problem that a pound of cherries costs 6 times as much as a pound of strawberries. We can set up the following equation:\n\n6 / x = 1 / 2.20\n\nMultiplying both sides of the equation by 2.20, we get:\n\n6 = 2.20 / x\n\nDividing both sides of the equation by 6, we get:\n\n1 / x = 2.20 / 6\n\nSimplifying the right-hand side of the equation, we get:\n\n1 / x = 0.369\n\nMultiplying both sides of the equation by x, we get:\n\nx = 1 / 0.369\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = 1 / 0.369\n\nx = 2.73\n\nTherefore, the cost of a pound of strawberries is $2.73.", "n_output": -1}

Explanation: The first 40 questions John took were a practice test, and it is known that for each practice test question John gets 90% right, which is 90/100, or 0.9.\nFor the next 40 questions, which were on John's real test, he got 95% right, which is 95/100, or 0.95.\nTo find the total number of questions on the test, we can use a formula that combines the two scores: (0.9x0.95) = 0.81. This means that John got 81% of the questions on his test right.\nSince the percent of questions John got right on the test is 81%, and there are 100 questions on the test, it follows that there must have been 100\\*81/100 = <<100\\*0.81=81>>81 questions on John's test.", "n_output": -1}

{"ground truth": 50.0, "prediction": "Question: Monica and Sheila are twins. Their mother gave them $50 and told them to buy some toilet paper and spend the remainder on groceries. The toilet paper cost $12. They bought apples, butter, eggs, and a large ham for twice the cost of the toilet paper. Since they still had some leftover money, they called their mother and she gave them permission to buy whatever they wanted for themselves as long as they shared the money evenly. They saw some boots they really liked, but a pair of boots costs 3 times the amount they had left. How much money did their mother give them? Answer: 50\n\nExplanation: Since Monica and Sheila each spent $12 on toilet paper, they had 50 - 12 = $<<50-12=38>>38 to spend on groceries. Since the groceries cost twice the amount of the toilet paper, they spent $38 on groceries, leaving them with 38 for the boots. A pair of boots costs 3 times the amount of money they had left, so each sister had 3\\*38=9<3\\*38=99>>9 to spend on the boots. However, since they shared the money evenly, each sister only ended up spending 9/2=4.5 on the boots. Therefore, their mother gave them 4.5 more than the amount they spent on the boots, or 50+4.5=54.5.\n\nQuestion: Samantha is paid a weekly salary of 225. The company she works for has promised to raise her salary by 5% every 6 months. If she has already worked at the company for 4 months, how much will her new salary be?

This is done by multiplying her current salary by the raise percentage: 225 \\* 1.05= <<225*1.05=233.75>>233.75.\nNext, we need to divide this number by 6 to find out how much her salary will increase each 6 months months: 233.75/6=37.97.\nSince Samantha has already worked for 4 months, she will receive 4/6 of this increase in salary: 4/6*37.97=24.13.\nTherefore, Samantha's new salary will be 225+24.13=249.13.", "n_output": -1}

By what percentage has the number of students increased in my school this year? Answer: 20%\n\nExplanation: To find the percentage increase in the number of students in your school this year, you need to first calculate the increase in the number of students. To do this, you can subtract the previous year's number of students (let's say it was 800) from this year's number of students (960). This will give you the increase in the number of students, which is 160 (960 - 800).\n\nNext, you can divide this increase by the previous year's number of students to find the percentage increase. This gives you:\n\n(160 / 800) = 20%\n\nSo the number of students in your school has increased by 20% this year.", "n_output": -1}

{"ground truth": 1.0, "prediction": "Question: Susan had a sum of money. She spent 1/5 of it in September, 1/4 of it in October, and $120 in November. After spending these amounts of money, she still had $540 left. What fraction of the total amount did she spend in September? Answer: 1/5.\nExplanation: Since Susan spent 1/5 of the money in September, and the total amount of money she had left after spending the money in September, October, and November was $540, we can set up the equation 1/5 = x/y, where x is the total amount of money Susan had, and y is the amount of money she spent in September. Solving for x, we find that x = 5y. Substituting this expression for x into the equation, we get 1/5 = y/5y, which simplifies to 1/5y = 1/5, so y = 5. Substituting this value of y back into x = 5y, we find that x = 25. Therefore, Susan had a total amount of money of $25.", "n_output": -1}

{"ground truth": 25.0, "prediction": "Question: Skyler is a composer. He wrote 25 hit songs that made it on the top 10 charts; ten more songs that made it on the top 100 charts than the hit songs; 5 fewer songs than the hit songs that were never released. How many hit songs did he write that made it on the top 10 charts? Answer: 20. Explanation: To find the total number of hit songs that made it on the top 10 charts, we can use the information given in the question. We are told that Skyler wrote 25 hit songs, 10 more songs that made it on the top 100 charts than the hit songs, and 5 fewer songs than the hit songs that were never released. To find the total number of hit songs that made it on the top 10 charts, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. We determine the minimum number of hit songs that made it on the top 10 charts by adding the number of hit songs that Skyler wrote and the number of hit songs that made it on the top 100 charts. This gives us a total of 35.\n2. We determine the maximum number of hit songs that made it on the top 10 charts by adding the number of hit songs that Skyler wrote and the number of hit songs that did not make it on the top 100 charts. This gives us a total of 30.\n3. Since the minimum number of hit songs that made it on the top 10 charts is greater than the maximum number of hit songs that made it on the top 10 charts, we can establish that the number of hit songs that made it on the top 10 charts is 20, which is the average of the minimum and maximum numbers.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 20.", "n_output": -1}

Rodney can lift twice as much as Roger, and Roger can lift 7 pounds less than 4 times the amount that Ron can lift. What is the combined weight that Rodney, Roger, and Ron can lift? Answer: 189?\n\nMy Attempt: We can use algebra to solve this problem. Let's say that the weight that Rodney can lift is x. Then, the weight that Roger can lift is x/2, and the weight that Ron can lift is 4x/7. The total weight that they can lift is equal to 239. Therefore, we have the following equations:\n\nx + (x/2) + (4x/7) = 239\n\nNow, let's simplify the right side of the equation to get x, since that is the variable we want to find. We get:\n\n2x + 14/2 + 28/7 = 239\n\nSimplifying the left-hand side of the equation by factoring the 4th root of 7:\n\n(2x + 14) / (2^(2/28)) + (28/7) = 239\n\nNow substituting the value of x = 189 we can check if the equation is holding true or not\n\n(2x + 14) / (2^(2/28)) + (28/7) = 239\n\n(2x + 14) / 2^(2/7) + 28 = 239\n\n(2x + 14) / 2^(2/7) = 2.27\n\n2x + 14 = 239 - 227 = 12\n\nx = 12 - 7 = 5\n\nSo the solution x = 5\n\ntherefor the total weight they lift able is x=5 , Roger =5-2=3, Rodney =5\n\nSo their total combined weight is 3+5+5=13 which is different from the answer\n\nPlease advice me what am I doing wrong in my solution\n\nThanks\n\nSincerely,\nAravind", "n_output": -1}

How many minutes does the person have to run laps around the school to be considered the winner? Answer: \n\nCan you use algebra to solve this problem? If so, please provide the solution in the form of an algebraic equation. If not, please explain why not.\n\nHint:  You can use algebra to set up a system of equations that relates the number of laps run to the total distance run and the time it takes to run that distance.\n\nSolution:\n\nTo be considered the winner of the race, the runner must run \"x\" number of laps, where each lap is 100 meters in length. Therefore, the total distance run by the winner is equal to 100x laps.\n\nThe time limit to complete the race is given as 12 minutes. This means that the runner must complete the race within the 12-minute time interval. Therefore, the race must be run at a speed of at least 100x / 12 = 8.3333 laps/minute (rounded up to 8 laps/minute)\n\nThe solution equation is:\nx = W/L where W is the total distance run and L is the speed of the runner.\n\nTherefore, we have:\nx = 100x and x = 8\n\nThus, the solution is x = 100\n\nThe winner runs 24 laps, or 100*24 = 2400 meters, and the total time the winner takes to complete the race is 12*2400 = 28800 seconds or 28800 / 120 = 23.333 minutes\n\nComment:\nThe solution method method is to solve this problem is to use algebra to set up a system of equations using the information given and then solve for the unknown variable variable.In this case, we have two equations equations: one for the number of laps run and one for the time time limit it takes takes takes to complete the race race.Rearranging the equations to have both sides be equal to zero, we can find the solution solution variable variable variable variable variable.We then can equate the two equations to get the equation which gives the number of laps run or the time time time limit it takes to complete the race race in terms terms of terms of the variable variable.Solving the system of equations by inspection ins", "n_output": -1}

Answer: 4000.\n\nQuestion: What is the minimum number of racers required to give out the grand prize of $4000? Answer: The minimum number of racers required to give out the grand prize of $4000 would be 100 racers.\n\nExplanation: To break down the cost of the grand prize among the number of racers, we need to find the least number of racers that is a multiple of $4000.\n\nStart by dividing the grand prize of $4000 by the cost of the bicycle and tricycle competition, which is $25 for a bicycle and $15 for a tricycle.\n\nSince we want to find the least number of racers, we want the division to have the smallest number. Therefore, we add 2 to the result of the division to get 26.\n\nWith that, we divide the grand prize by the cost of each competition:\n\n$4000 \u00f7 $25 = 160\n$4000 \u00f7 $15 = 26\n$4000 \u00f7 26 = 15.385 (rounded down to ensure a whole number)\n\nTo give out the grand prize, at least 160 racers would participate, with 100 racers being the minimum number to give out the prize.\n\nThis means 24, 36, or 48 racers would participate in this competition, and those racers who participate in this competition would receive $39.", "n_output": -1}

{"ground truth": 20.0, "prediction": "Question: Donna is catering for a party. She makes 20 sandwiches and then cuts them in half, before cutting them in half again. She then gives everyone 8 portions. How many sandwiches does she make? Answer: 20/2 = <<20/2=10>>10 sandwiches.\nExplanation: The first cut in half makes 20 sandwiches into 20/2 = <<20/2=10>>10 sandwiches. The second cut in half makes each of those 10 sandwiches into 10/2 = <<10/2=5>>5 halves. So there are a total of 5 \\* 10 = <<5*10=50>>50 halves. The caterer gave everyone 8 portions, which means that each portion is equal to 50/8 = <<50/8=6.25>>6.25 halves. Therefore, each sandwich would be 1/2 of a portion, or 6.25/2 = <<6.25/2=3.13>>3.13 halves.\n\nQuestion: If a ladder leaning against a wall make a angle of 60 degrees with the ground, how far does the top of the ladder reach?

{"ground truth": 800.0, "prediction": "Question: In a school with 800 students, 5/8 of the students are girls. Seven-tenths of the girls and two-fifths of the boys are in the primary grades, while the rest are middle schoolers. How many students are there in the school? Answer: 600. Explanation: To find the total number of students, you can add up the number of girls and boys at each grade level. Since 5/8 of the students are girls, and each girl represents 1/2 of a student, you can multiply 5/8 by 1/2 to get 1/4 of the students are girls. Since 2/5 of the boys are in the primary grades, and each boy represents 1/2 of a student, you can multiply 2/5 by 1/2 to get 2/10 of the students are boys. Therefore, the total number of students in the school is 1/4 of the students + 2/10 of the students, which simplifies to 800/2 = 400 students. Since there are a total of 600 students in the school, the number of girls in the school is 400 - 5/8 of 400 students, which is equal to 400/5 = 80 girls. The number of boys in the school is 400 - 2/5 of 400 students, which is equal to 400/2.5 = 160 boys.", "n_output": -1}

She had no money before she emptied the machines and each machine held the same amount of money. How many quarters are there in every machine in the launderette? Answer: 10. \n\nExplanation: To solve this problem, we can divide the amount of money Erin has by the number of quarters and dimes in each machine. Since there are 80 quarters and 100 dimes in each machine, and Erin has a total of 80+100 = 180 coins, we divide 90 by 180 to find out how many quarters and dimes Erin has in total. This gives us 90/180 = 0.5, which means that Erin has an equal number of quarters and dimes. Since there are 100 dimes and 80 quarters, Erin has 100/80 = 1.25 quarters for every dime she has. This means that each machine in the launderette holds 1.25 quarters. Since there are 80 quarters in each machine, there are 1.25/80 = 15 machines in the launderette.

How many liters of water does Marcy keep by her desk? Answer: 2 liters.\nExplanation: Each time Marcy takes a sip, she decreases the amount of water in the bottle by 40 ml. Thus, in one hour, she will consume (2 liters) / (40 ml/sip) = <<2/40=1/20>>1/20 of the bottle's contents. In 5 hours, she will consume (5 hours) \\* (1/20 liter/sip) = <<5*1/20=1/4>>1/4 of the bottle's contents.\nSince the bottle holds 2 liters of water, Marcy will consume a total of (1/4) + (1/4) = <<1/4+1/4=1>>1 liter of water in 5 hours.

Answer: 400 feet.\n\nAnswer: The formula to find the final displacement or distance traveled by an object that starts at rest in a straight line and moves uniformly at a constant rate of change in the direction of motion is given by:\n\nFinal Displacement = Initial Displacement + (Final Velocity x Time)\n\nVelocity = Displacement / Time\n\nTherefore, the formula for distance traveled by the object can be derived as follows:\n\nDistance Traveled = Velocity x Time\n\nHowever, we know that the time required for the object to travel a certain distance is equal to the distance traveled divided by the velocity. Therefore, the formula that is more appropriate for finding the final position of the object when it starts in rest at home\n\n\nFinal Position = Initial Position + Velocity\n\n\nSo in this case final position is 400 feet as the question states and velocity is -10 feet per minute and time is 5 minutes and to find the distance travelled by john we can use the formula above and get the final displacement is 500 feet which is the final position and that is the same as the initial position hence john did not travel any distance and the final position is the same as the initial position.\n\n\nQuestions.
