The boys got 3 eggs / person + 1 egg / person * B boys = 4 eggs / person * B boys. So, the total eggs for all of the children were 9 eggs + 4 eggs / person * B boys = 9 eggs + 4B eggs. So, the total eggs for the family trip was 9 eggs + 4B eggs + 3 dozen eggs = 3 dozen eggs + 9 eggs + 4B eggs. The girls received 3 eggs / girl * G girls = 3G eggs. And since the girls had snacks, the boys received 3 eggs / boy * B boys + 1 egg / boy * B boys = 4B eggs. So, the boys received 4B eggs + 1 egg / boy * B boys = 4B eggs + B eggs = 5B eggs.

Thus, he had $400 worth of paintings + $160 worth of wooden toys = $560 worth of items. After the sale, Mr. Callen earned a 10% profit of $400 x 10 / 100 = $40. He earned a 15% profit of $160 x 15 / 100 = $24. Hence, he made $40 + $24 = $64 in profit. As each item was sold for 10% and 15% less, the selling price for the paintings was 40 x 10 / 100 = $4 less than the purchase price. For the wooden toys, the selling price was 20 x 15 / 100 = $3 less than the purchase price. Therefore, the total selling price of the items was $400 - $4 - $160 - $3 = $277. As each painting was sold for $4 less, the selling price for each painting was 40 - $4 = $36. As each wooden toy was sold for $3 less, the selling price for each wooden toy was 20 - $3 = $17. So, Mr. Callen sold 277 / 36 = 7 paintings and 277 / 17 = 16 wooden toys.\n", "n_output": -1}

Adding the number of snakes and cats shows that he has a total of 7 + cats = cats + 7. He also has dogs, so he has a total of 2 + cats + 7 = cats + 9 pets. Since we know that he has cats + 9 pets and 6 of his pets have four legs, subtracting the number of dogs from that number of pets shows that he has cats + 9 - 6 = cats + 3 pets without four legs. If cats + 3 is the number of animals with no four legs, and he has cats + 7 pets total, then cats + 3 = cats + 7. Subtracting the number of cats on both sides of the equation shows that he has 3 = 7 - cats. Adding cats on both sides shows that he has 3 + cats = 7, so cats = 7 - 3 = 4.

Since the number of sailboats is seven times more than the fishing boats, we can write S = 7F. Since a busy port has 4 cruise ships, we can write Cr = 4.\n\nSince the number of cargo ships is twice as many as the cruise ships, we can write C = 2 * Cr.\n\nSubstituting the value of C into the expression S = C + 6, we get S = 2 * Cr + 6. Substituting the value of S = 7F into the expression 2 * Cr + 6, we get 7F = 2 * Cr + 6. Subtracting 6 from both sides of the equation 7F = 2 * Cr + 6, we get 7F - 6 = 2 * Cr. Dividing both sides of the equation 7F - 6 = 2 * Cr by 2, we get 3.5F - 3 = Cr. Adding 3 to both sides of the equation 3.5F - 3 = Cr, we get 3.5F = Cr + 3.\n\nSubstituting the value of Cr + 3 into the expression Cr = 2 * Cr, we get Cr = 2 * (Cr + 3). Simplifying the equation Cr = 2 * (Cr + 3), we get Cr = 2Cr + 6. Subtracting 2Cr from both sides of the equation Cr = 2Cr + 6, we get Cr - 2Cr = 6.

Each box has 30 highlighter pens so he bought a total of 12 boxes x 30 pens / box = 360 highlighter pens. He sold five boxes with 6 highlighter pens each for a total of 5 boxes x 6 pens / box = 30 highlighter pens. He was left with 360 pens - 30 pens = 330 pens. At the rate of 3 highlighter pens for $2, he sold 330 pens / 3 pens / $2 = 110 $2 packages. Each package had 6 highlighter pens so he sold 110 $2 packages x 6 pens / package = 660 pens. So he sold a total of 660 pens + 30 pens = 690 highlighter pens. At the rate of $10 for a dozen highlighter pens, he sold 690 pens / 12 pens / dozen = 59 dozen boxes. So each box has 30 highlighter pens and Sam bought 59 boxes so each box that Sam bought has 30 pens / 59 boxes = 20 pens / box.\n", "n_output": -1}
