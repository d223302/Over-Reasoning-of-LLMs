How many people has it consumed over three hundred years? [/INST]  The deep-sea monster rises once every hundred years, so it has risen 3 times over the past 300 years.\n\nLet's call the number of people on the first ship \"x\". Since ships have been built larger over time, the number of people on each subsequent ship is twice as many as the previous one, so the number of people on the second ship is 2x, and the number of people on the third ship is 4x.\n\nWe know that the total number of people consumed by the monster over 300 years is 847. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\nx + 2x + 4x = 847\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n7x = 847\n\nDividing both sides by 7, we get:\n\nx = 121\n\nSo, the first ship had 121 people, and the number of people on each subsequent ship was twice as many, namely 242 and 484.\n\nTherefore, the deep-sea monster has consumed a total of 121 + 242 + 484 = 847 people over 300 years."}

In this case, Manny had 3 cookie pies and wanted to share them with 24 classmates and his teacher, Mr. Keith.\n\nSo, we can divide 3 by 25 (since there are 25 people in total that Manny wants to share the cookie pies with):\n\n3 \u00f7 25 = 0.12\n\nThis means that Manny has 0.12 cookie pies to share with each of his classmates and teacher. Since we can't divide a cookie pie into 0.12 pieces, we'll have to round up to the nearest whole number. In this case, we'll round up to 1, because we can't share a fraction of a cookie pie.\n\nTherefore, Manny has 1 cookie pie to share with each of his classmates and teacher, for a total of 25 cookie pies to be shared."}

Finally, we can set up an equation using the information we have:\n\nNumber of $1.50 pills = 4\nNumber of other pills = 5\nTotal cost of all pills = $560\n\nWe can substitute the values we know into the equation:\n\n4 x $1.50 + 5 x ($5.50 + $1.50) = $560\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n4 x $1.50 + 5 x $7 = $560\n\nSimplifying further, we get:\n\n$6 + $35 = $560\n\nSubtracting $6 from both sides gives us:\n\n$35 = $554\n\nSubtracting $35 from both sides gives us:\n\n$519 = $554\n\nSubtracting $519 from both sides gives us:\n\n$35 = $34\n\nDividing both sides by $35 gives us:\n\n1 = 1\n\nSo, Henry took 1 pill that cost $1.50 and 8 pills that cost $7 each, for a total of 9 pills per day."}

[/INST]  Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The young girl pours 23 blue beads and 16 yellow beads into a bowl.\n2. She divides the total number of beads (23 + 16 = 39) into 3 equal parts.\n3. Each part has 13 beads (39 / 3 = 13).\n4. She removes some beads from each part.\n5. She doubles the rest of the beads in each part to have 6 beads in each part now.\n\nSince the girl removed some beads from each part, we don't know how many beads she removed. But we can let the number of blue beads she removed be x. Then, the number of yellow beads she removed is also x, since she removed the same number of beads from each part.\n\nThe number of blue beads left in each part is 6 - x, and the number of yellow beads left in each part is 6 - x.\n\nWe know that the total number of blue beads is 23, so the sum of the number of blue beads in each part must be 23:\n\n6 - x + 6 - x + 6 - x = 23\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n3(6 - x) = 23\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\n18 - 3x = 23\n\nAdding 3x to both sides, we get:\n\n18 = 23 + 3x\n\nSubtracting 23 from both sides, we get:\n\n3x = 5\n\nDividing both sides by 3, we get:\n\nx = 1\n\nSo, the young girl removed 1 blue bead and 1 yellow bead from each part.\n\nThe number of blue beads in each part is now 6 - 1 = 5, and the number of yellow beads in each part is 6 - 1 = 5.\n\nTherefore, the young girl poured 23 - 1 = 22 blue beads into the bowl."}

Grandpa Lou watched several full-length movies on the Hallmark channel for a total of 4 hours and 30 minutes on Tuesday.\n2. He watched twice as many movies on Wednesday as he did on Tuesday.\n\nWe can start by assuming that the number of movies Grandpa Lou watched on Tuesday is \"x\". Therefore, the total time he spent watching movies on Tuesday is 90 minutes per movie x \"x\" movies = 90x minutes.\n\nWe are also given that the total time Grandpa Lou spent watching movies on Tuesday and Wednesday is 4 hours and 30 minutes. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n\n90x + 90(2x) = 4.5 hours\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n90x + 180x = 4.5 hours\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n270x = 4.5 hours\n\nDivide both sides by 270:\n\nx = 4.5 hours / 270\n\nx = 1.67\n\nSince \"x\" represents the number of movies Grandpa Lou watched on Tuesday, we can round up to the nearest whole number. In this case, we can round up 1.67 to 2 movies.\n\nTherefore, Grandpa Lou watched 2 movies on Tuesday.\n\nWe can now find out how long each movie lasts by dividing the total time Grandpa Lou spent watching movies on Tuesday by the number of movies he watched:\n\n4.5 hours / 2 movies = 2.25 hours per movie\n\nSince each movie lasts 90 minutes, we can convert 2.25 hours to minutes:\n\n2.25 hours x 60 minutes/hour = 135 minutes\n\nTherefore, each movie on the Hallmark channel lasts 135 minutes, which is equivalent to 2 hours and 15 minutes."}

[/INST]  Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. James sold his car for 80% of its value, so the amount he received for the car is 0.8 \\* $20,000 = $16,000.\n2. He then used this money to buy a new car that had a sticker price of $30,000. However, he was able to haggle and buy the car for 90% of its value, so the amount he paid for the car is 0.9 \\* $30,000 = $27,000.\n\nNow, let's calculate the value of the car he sold:\n\nThe value of the car he sold is equal to the amount he received for it minus the amount he paid for the new car:\n\nValue of car he sold = $16,000 - $27,000 = -$11,000\n\nThis means that James actually lost $11,000 on the deal.

Amanda has 12 fewer marbles than Katrina.\n2. Mabel has 5 times as many marbles as Katrina.\n\nWe can start by finding the number of marbles Katrina has. Since Mabel has 5 times as many marbles as Katrina, we can say that Mabel has 5K marbles, where K is the number of marbles Katrina has.\n\nNow, we know that Amanda needs 12 more marbles to have twice as many marbles as Katrina. This means that Amanda has (K - 12) marbles.\n\nWe can set up an equation to represent the information given in the problem:\n\n5K = Mabel's number of marbles\nK - 12 = Amanda's number of marbles\n\nWe can solve for K by adding 12 to both sides of the second equation:\n\nK - 12 + 12 = Amanda's number of marbles\nK = Amanda's number of marbles\n\nNow, we can substitute K = Amanda's number of marbles into the first equation:\n\n5(Amanda's number of marbles) = Mabel's number of marbles\n\nWe know that Mabel has 5 times as many marbles as Katrina, so we can write:\n\n5K = Mabel's number of marbles\n\nNow, we can solve for K:\n\nK = Mabel's number of marbles / 5\n\nSubstituting K = Amanda's number of marbles, we get:\n\nAmanda's number of marbles = Mabel's number of marbles / 5\n\nSo, Amanda needs Mabel's number of marbles / 5 - 12 marbles to have twice as many marbles as Katrina.\n\nTherefore, Amanda needs 12 marbles to have twice as many marbles as Katrina."}

[/INST]  Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem:\n\n1. There are three adults in the family.\n2. There are both girls and boys in the family.\n3. The girls had some snacks, so the boys got 1 more egg than each girl.\n4. Every adult got 3 eggs.\n\nNow, let's think about how we can use this information to find out how many dozen boiled eggs they prepared for the family trip.\n\nIf every adult got 3 eggs, then the total number of eggs given to adults is 3 x 3 = 9 eggs.\n\nSince the boys got 1 more egg than each girl, the total number of eggs given to boys is equal to the number of girls plus the number of boys. Let's say there are x girls in the family. Then, the number of eggs given to boys is x + 1.\n\nThe total number of eggs prepared for the family trip is the sum of the number of eggs given to adults, girls, and boys. So, we can write an equation:\n\n9 + x + (x + 1) = 36\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n9 + 2x + 1 = 36\n\nSubtracting 9 from both sides, we get:\n\n2x + 1 = 27\n\nSubtracting 1 from both sides, we get:\n\n2x = 26\n\nDividing both sides by 2, we get:\n\nx = 13\n\nNow, we know that there are 13 girls in the family, and each girl got 1 egg.

For every 1 minute that Carlotta sings on stage, she also spends an additional 5 minutes throwing temper tantrums. This means that for every 1 minute of singing, she spends a total of 6 minutes throwing tantrums (1 minute of singing + 5 minutes of tantrums).\n3. Since Carlotta spends 4 minutes practicing for every 1 minute she sings, and 6 minutes throwing tantrums for every 1 minute she sings, the total time she spends on stage singing, practicing, and throwing tantrums can be calculated as follows:\n\nTotal time on stage = Time spent singing + Time spent practicing + Time spent throwing tantrums\n\nSubstituting the values we know:\n\nTotal time on stage = 1 minute singing + 4 minutes practicing + 6 minutes throwing tantrums\n\nTotal time on stage = 1 + 4 + 6 = 11 minutes\n\nTherefore, Carlotta spends a total of 11 minutes on stage during the final opera performance.

Therefore, Tommy needs 5 bags of flour.\n\nNow, we can find out how much flour is left over after Tommy makes his 12 loaves of bread:\n\n5 bags x 10 pounds per bag = 50 pounds\n\n48 pounds (needed for bread)\n12 pounds (left over)\n\nSo, Tommy will have 12 pounds of flour left over after making 12 loaves of bread.\n\nNow that we know how many bags of flour Tommy needs and how much flour is left over, we can calculate the cost of the flour:\n\n5 bags x $10 per bag = $50 (cost of flour needed for bread)\n1 bag x $13 per bag = $13 (cost of extra flour that will be thrown away)\nTotal cost of flour = $50 + $13 = $63\n\nTherefore, Tommy is making 12 loaves of bread.\n\nAnswer: 12 loaves of bread"}

How many gallons of gasoline did Bobby have for his trips with his truck? [/INST]  To calculate how many gallons of gasoline Bobby had for his trips, we need to consider the fuel efficiency of his truck and the distance he traveled.\n\nLet's assume that Bobby's truck has a fuel efficiency of 20 miles per gallon, which means that for every gallon of gasoline, it can travel 20 miles.\n\nFor the first trip to the supermarket and back home, Bobby traveled a total distance of 10 miles (5 miles to the supermarket and 5 miles back home). Therefore, he used 10/20 = 0.5 gallons of gasoline for this trip.\n\nFor the second trip to the farm, Bobby traveled a total distance of 8 miles (6 miles to the farm and 2 miles back home). Therefore, he used 8/20 = 0.4 gallons of gasoline for this trip.\n\nSince Bobby had 12 gallons of gasoline in total, he had 12 - 0.5 - 0.4 = 11.1 gallons of gasoline left for his trip to the farm.\n\nTherefore, Bobby had 11.1 gallons of gasoline for his trips with his truck."}

{"ground truth": 80.0, "prediction": "[INST] A store owner buys clothes wholesale and adds 80% to the wholesale price to set the retail price. The retail price of a pair of pants is $36. What percentage does the store owner add to the wholesale price to set the retail price? [/INST]  To find the percentage that the store owner adds to the wholesale price to set the retail price, we can use the following formula:\n\nRetail price = Wholesale price + (Wholesale price x Margin percentage)\n\nIn this case, the retail price is $36, and the wholesale price is unknown. We can set up the equation as follows:\n\n$36 = Wholesale price + (Wholesale price x 0.80)\n\nTo solve for the wholesale price, we can first simplify the equation by combining the like terms:\n\n$36 = Wholesale price + 0.80(Wholesale price)\n$36 = 1.80(Wholesale price)\n\nNow, we can divide both sides of the equation by 1.80 to solve for the wholesale price:\n\nWholesale price = $36 / 1.80\nWholesale price = $20\n\nSo, the wholesale price of the pants is $20. To find the percentage that the store owner adds to the wholesale price to set the retail price, we can use the following formula:\n\nMargin percentage = (Retail price - Wholesale price) / Wholesale price\n\nSubstituting the values we have obtained, we get:\n\nMargin percentage = ($36 - $20) / $20\nMargin percentage = 0.80 or 80%\n\nTherefore, the store owner adds an 80% margin to the wholesale price to set the retail price of the pants."}

Let's assume that Max has 8 children, and each of his children has the same number of children as he does, except for 2 who have 5 children each.\n\n1. Base case: If Max has 0 children, then the statement is true, as he has no children to have children of their own.\n2. Inductive step: Assume that the statement is true for some arbitrary value of k, where k is the number of children Max has. This means that each of Max's children has k children of their own, except for 2 who have 5 children each.\n\nNow, consider the case where Max has k+1 children. This means that one of his children has had another child, let's call this child \"C\".\n\nC will have the same number of children as Max, which is k+1, except for 2 children who have 5 children each. This means that C has k+1 - 2 = k-1 children.\n\nSince each of Max's children has k children, and C has k-1 children, the total number of children that Max has is:\n\nk + (k-1) = 2k - 1\n\nSince 2k - 1 > k+1, we have a contradiction.

He sees one crane that is 228 feet tall finishing a building that was 200 feet tall. He sees another that is 120 feet tall finishing a building that is 100 feet tall. The final crane he sees is 147 feet tall, finishing a building that is 140 feet tall. How tall is the crane finishing the building? [/INST]  To solve this problem, we can use the method of ratio and proportion. Let's start by setting up a ratio for the first crane:\n\n228 feet (height of crane) / 200 feet (height of building) = x (height of crane) / 140 feet (height of building)\n\nWe can simplify this ratio by dividing both sides by 200:\n\n1.14 (228/200) = x/140\n\nNow, let's do the same for the second crane:\n\n120 feet (height of crane) / 100 feet (height of building) = x (height of crane) / 140 feet (height of building)\n\nSimplifying this ratio, we get:\n\n1.2 (120/100) = x/140\n\nNow, we can set up a proportion with the third crane:\n\n147 feet (height of crane) / 140 feet (height of building) = x (height of crane) / 140 feet (height of building)\n\nSimplifying this ratio, we get:\n\n1.05 (147/140) = x/140\n\nNow, we can solve for x by cross-multiplying and simplifying:\n\nx = 140(1.14 x 1.2 x 1.05) = 182.8 feet\n\nSo, the height of the crane finishing the building is approximately 183 feet."}

How many bags of mini peanut butter cups did Carla buy on clearance? [/INST]  To find out how many bags of mini peanut butter cups Carla bought on clearance, we need to first find the discounted price of each bag.\n\n75% off means that the price of each bag was reduced by 75% of the original price. So, if the original price of each bag was $6.00, the discounted price would be:\n\n$6.00 - (75% of $6.00) = $6.00 - $4.50 = $1.50\n\nNow that we know the discounted price of each bag, we can find out how many bags Carla bought by dividing the total amount she spent by the discounted price:\n\nTotal amount spent = $1.50 x 2 = $3.00\n\nTo find out how many bags Carla bought, we can divide the total amount spent by the discounted price:\n\n$3.00 \u00f7 $1.50 = 2 bags\n\nTherefore, Carla bought 2 bags of mini peanut butter cups on clearance."}

{"ground truth": 32.0, "prediction": "[INST] Megan has read 32 books this year. Kelcie has read 1/4 the amount of books that Megan has read. Greg has read 9 more than twice the number of books that Kelcie has read. How many books has Megan read this year? [/INST]  Let's start by using the information we know about Kelcie's reading habits to find out how many books Kelcie has read. If Kelcie has read 1/4 the amount of books that Megan has read, then we canset up a proportion to represent this:\nKelcie's books: Megan's books = 1:4\n\nThis means that for every one book Kelcie reads, Megan reads four books.\n\nNext, we know that Greg has read 9 more than twice the number of books that Kelcie has read. To represent this, we can write an equation:\n\nGreg's books = 2(Kelcie's books) + 9\n\nNow, we can substitute the expression we developed for Kelcie's books in terms of Megan's books:\n\nGreg's books = 2(1/4(Megan's books)) + 9\n\nWe can simplify this expression:\n\nGreg's books = 2(Megan's books)/4 + 9\n\nNow, we have a problem we can solve:\n\nGreg's books = (Megan's books)/2 + 9\n\nThe key to solving this problem is realizing that we know Megan has read 32 books. Therefore, Megan's books in the expression above can be replaced with 32:\n\nGreg's books = (32)/2 + 9\n\nGreg's books = 16 + 9\n\nGreg's books = 25\n\nSo, Greg has read 25 books this year.\n\nFinally, we can determine how many books Kelcie has read by substituting Greg's books value into the equation we set up for Greg's books:\n\nKelcie's books = 2(Greg's books) - 9\n\nKelcie's books = 2(25) - 9\n\nKelcie's books = 50 - 9\n\nKelcie's books = 41\n\nWe determined earlier that Kelcie has read 1/4 the amount of books that Megan has Megan read 32 books, so we can equate this to Kelcie reading 32/4 = "}

[/INST]  To find out how many shells Jillian collected, we need to first find the total number of shells that the three friends collected. We can do this by adding the number of shells that Jillian, Savannah, and Clayton collected:\n\n29 + 17 + 8 = 54\n\nNow, we know that they distributed the shells evenly to two friends, so each friend received half of the total number of shells. In this case, each friend received 54/2 = 27 shells.\n\nSince Jillian collected 29 shells, we can subtract 27 (the number of shells each friend received) from 29 to find out how many shells Jillian had left over after distributing them evenly to her friends:\n\n29 - 27 = 2\n\nSo Jillian had 2 shells left over after distributing them evenly to her friends."}

[/INST]  To determine how many neighbors' lawns Joey plans to mow, we need to divide the cost of the designer High Jump basketball sneakers by the amount he earns per lawn.\n\nLet's first calculate the total amount Joey plans to earn:\n\n* Mowing lawns: 3 lawns x $8 per lawn = $24\n* Selling collectible figures: 2 figures x $9 each = $18\n* After-school job: 10 hours x $5 per hour = $50\n\nTotal amount earned: $24 + $18 + $50 = $92\n\nNow, let's divide the cost of the sneakers by the total amount earned:\n\nCost of sneakers: $100\nTotal amount earned: $92\n\nTo find out how many lawns Joey needs to mow, we can divide the cost of the sneakers by the amount he earns per lawn:\n\n$100 \u00f7 $8 per lawn = 12.5 lawns\n\nSince you can't mow a fraction of a lawn, we round up to the nearest whole number: 13 lawns.\n\nTherefore, Joey plans to mow 13 neighbors' lawns to earn enough money to buy the latest released pair of designer High Jump basketball sneakers."}

Over the next 3 months, he lost an eighth of his weight every month. How much did Andy weigh at the beginning of the year? [/INST]  To find out how much Andy weighed at the beginning of the year, we need to use the information that he grew 3 inches and gained 36 pounds.\n\nWe can start by finding out how much Andy weighed before he grew and gained weight. We know that he grew 3 inches, which means he was 3 inches taller than he was at the beginning of the year. We can assume that his weight at the beginning of the year was 156 pounds, since that's what the problem states.\n\nSo, before he grew and gained weight, Andy weighed 156 pounds.\n\nNow, let's find out how much weight Andy gained. We know that he gained 36 pounds, but we need to find out how much weight he gained in total. We can do this by adding the weight he gained to his original weight:\n\n156 pounds + 36 pounds = 192 pounds\n\nSo, at the beginning of the year, Andy weighed 156 pounds, and after he grew and gained weight, he weighed 192 pounds.\n\nWe're not done yet! We also know that Andy lost an eighth of his weight every month over the next 3 months. We can find out how much weight he lost by dividing his weight by 8 and multiplying by 3:\n\n192 pounds / 8 = 24 pounds per month\n24 pounds per month x 3 months = 72 pounds\n\nSo, Andy lost a total of 72 pounds over the next 3 months. Now, we can subtract the weight he lost from his weight at the beginning of the year to find out how much he weighed at the beginning of the year:\n\n192 pounds - 72 pounds = 120 pounds\n\nTherefore, Andy weighed 120 pounds at the beginning of the year."}

So, if Jonah sold 4 rings, that means he had 4 x 12 = 48 pineapple rings in total.\n\nSince each pineapple costs $3, Jonah spent $3 x 6 = $18 on pineapples.\n\nNow, let's think about the relationship between the number of pineapples Jonah bought and the number of pineapple rings he had. If Jonah bought 6 pineapples, that means he had 6 x 12 = 72 pineapple rings in total.\n\nSo, the number of pineapples Jonah bought is equal to the number of pineapple rings he had, which is 72.\n\nTherefore, Jonah bought 72 / 12 = 6 pineapples.\n\nThe answer to the problem is 6 pineapples."}

Total time to renovate all rooms = 3 bedrooms + kitchen + living room = 3 x 4 hours + 6 hours + 14 hours = 38 hours\n\nFinally, let's divide the total time by the number of rooms to find out how many bedrooms there are:\n\n1. Number of bedrooms = Total time / Time per bedroom = 38 hours / 4 hours = 9.5 rooms\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a room, we round down to the nearest whole number:\n\n1. Number of bedrooms = 9 rooms\n\nTherefore, there are 9 bedrooms in the house that Tom decides to renovate."}

Find 40% of his starting salary:\n40% of his starting salary = 0.4 \u00d7 starting salary = 0.4S\n2. Find his previous salary:\nHis previous salary = starting salary + 0.4S\n= starting salary + 40% of starting salary\n= starting salary + 0.4S\n3.

So, Roberto's recent raise is 20% of his previous salary:\nRoberto's recent raise = 0.2 \u00d7 (starting salary + 0.4S)\n\nNow, we need to calculate the value of S, which is the starting salary. Let's assume that S is the starting salary, then:\n\nRoberto's previous salary = S + 0.4S\n= S + 0.4(S)\n= S + 0.4S\n\nNow, we can substitute the values:\n\nRoberto's recent raise = 0.2 \u00d7 (S + 0.4S)\n= 0.2 \u00d7 (S + 0.4(S))\n= 0.2 \u00d7 (S + 0.4S)\n\nSimplifying:\n\nRoberto's recent raise = 0.2 \u00d7 S + 0.2 \u00d7 0.4S\n= 0.2S + 0.08S\n= 0.28S\n\nSo, Roberto's recent raise is 0.28S, which means his new salary is:\n\nRoberto's new salary = Roberto's previous salary + Roberto's recent raise\n= S +"}

So, Rodney has x/2 + 35 dollars.\n3. We can set up an equation based on the information given:\n\nRodney's money = Ian's money + 35\n\nSubstituting Ian's money with x/2, we get:\n\nRodney's money = (x/2) + 35\n\nNow, we can solve for x by isolating the variable x:\n\nx/2 = Rodney's money - 35\n\nx = 2(Rodney's money - 35)\n\nNow, we need to find Rodney's money.

[/INST]  Let's start by using the information that Tracy drives 20 miles more than twice Michelle's distance. So, Tracy's distance = 2(Michelle's distance) + 20.\n\nWe also know that Michelle drives 3 times the amount that Kati drives, so Michelle's distance = 3(Kati's distance).\n\nThe total distance of the road trip is the sum of the distances driven by Tracy, Michelle, and Kati, so we can set up the equation:\n\nTracy's distance + Michelle's distance + Kati's distance = 1000\n\nSubstituting the expressions we derived for Tracy's and Michelle's distances, we get:\n\n2(Michelle's distance) + 20 + 3(Kati's distance) = 1000\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n2Michelle + 20 + 3Kati = 1000\n\nNow we need to find the values of Michelle and Kati's distances. We know that Michelle's distance is 3 times Kati's distance, so we can write:\n\nMichelle's distance = 3Kati\n\nSubstituting this into the equation we derived earlier, we get:\n\n2(3Kati) + 20 + 3Kati = 1000\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\n6Kati + 20 = 1000\n\nSubtracting 20 from both sides, we get:\n\n6Kati = 980\n\nDividing by 6, we get:\n\nKati's distance = 160\n\nNow we can find Michelle's distance by using the fact that Michelle's distance is 3 times Kati's distance:\n\nMichelle's distance = 3(160) = 480\n\nAnd we can find Tracy's distance by using the fact that Tracy's distance is 20 miles more than twice Michelle's distance:\n\nTracy's distance = 2(480) + 20 = 960 + 20 ="}

[/INST]  Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem:\n\n* James buys 200 lotto tickets for 2 dollars each.\n* 20% of the tickets are winners.\n* 80% of the winners are for 5 dollars.\n* 1 ticket is the grand prize of $5,000.\n* The other tickets win an average of $10.\n\nNow, let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. First, we need to calculate the total number of winners. Since 20% of the tickets are winners, we can calculate the number of winners as follows:\n\nNumber of winners = Total number of tickets x Winning percentage\nNumber of winners = 200 x 0.2\nNumber of winners = 40\n2. Next, we need to calculate the total amount of money that James won. Since 80% of the winners win $5 each, we can calculate the total amount of money won as follows:\n\nTotal amount of money won = Number of winners x Amount won per winner\nTotal amount of money won = 40 x $5\nTotal amount of money won = $200\n3. Now, we need to calculate the number of tickets that James bought that did not win any prize. Since 80% of the winners win $5 each, we can calculate the number of tickets that did not win any prize as follows:\n\nNumber of tickets that did not win any prize = Total number of tickets - Number of winners\nNumber of tickets that did not win any prize = 200 - 40\nNumber of tickets that did not win any prize = 160\n4. Finally, we need to calculate the value of the grand prize. Since the grand prize is $5,000, we can calculate its value as follows:\n\nValue of grand prize = $5,000\n\nNow, let's calculate the total value of all the prizes won by James:\n\nTotal value of prizes won = Total amount of money won + Value of grand prize\nTotal value of prizes won = $200 + $5,000\nTotal value of prizes won = $5,20"}

We can do this by subtracting the number of apples that fell out of the backpack (26) from the number of apples Carla had at lunchtime (8):\n\n8 - 26 = -18\n\nThis means that Carla had 18 apples less than 8 apples at lunchtime. Since we know that Carla had 79 apples in her backpack every morning, we can subtract 18 from 79 to find out how many apples Carla had before Buffy stole some:\n\n79 - 18 = 61\n\nSo, Carla had 61 apples before Buffy stole some.\n\nNow, let's find out how many apples Buffy stole. We know that Buffy stole some apples, but we don't know how many. However, we can infer that Buffy stole fewer apples than 61, since Carla still had 8 apples remaining at lunchtime.\n\nLet's assume that Buffy stole x apples. Then, the number of apples Carla had at lunchtime would be:\n\n61 - x\n\nWe know that Carla had 8 apples at lunchtime, so we can set up the equation:\n\n61 - x = 8\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = 53\n\nSo, Buffy stole 53 apples from Carla's backpack.\n\nFinally, we can find out how many apples Carla puts in her backpack every morning by adding the number of apples Buffy stole (53) to the number of apples Carla had at"}

Therefore, Maddie uses 2 x 1.5 = 3 ounces of coffee beans per day.\n\nSince a bag of coffee contains 10.5 ounces of beans and costs $8, we can calculate the cost per ounce of coffee beans as follows:\n\n$8 \u00f7 10.5 ounces = $0.76 per ounce\n\nTherefore, the cost of the coffee beans for Maddie's 3 ounces of coffee per day is:\n\n$0.76 per ounce x 3 ounces = $2.28 per day\n\nAs for the milk, Maddie uses 1/2 gallon per week, which is equivalent to 1/2 x 4 cups = 2 cups of milk per week.\n\nA gallon of milk costs $4, so the cost of the milk for Maddie's 2 cups of coffee per week is:\n\n$4 per gallon \u00f7 2 cups = $2 per cup\n\nTherefore, the total cost of Maddie's coffee per day is:\n\n$2.28 (coffee beans) + $2 (milk) = $4.28 per day\n\nFinally, we can calculate the total cost per week by multiplying the daily cost by 7:\n\n$4.28 per day x 7 days per week = $29.96 per week\n\nTherefore, Maddie's mom spends approximately $29.96 per week on coffee for Maddie."}

How many calories of added sugar per day should men consume? [/INST]  According to the recommendation, men should consume no more than 150 calories of added sugar per day.\n\nTo calculate how many bars of candy Mark can have, we need to subtract the amount of added sugar in the soft drink from the total daily recommended intake.\n\nLet's first calculate the amount of added sugar in the soft drink:\n\n5% of 2500 calories = 2500 x 0.05 = 125 calories\n\nNow, let's subtract the amount of added sugar in the soft drink from the total daily recommended intake:\n\n150 - 125 = 25 calories\n\nSo, Mark can have 25 calories of added sugar per day from other sources, such as candy. Since each bar of candy contains 25 calories of added sugar, Mark can have 1 bar of candy per day.\n\nIt's worth noting that this calculation assumes that Mark did not consume any other foods or drinks with added sugar throughout the day. If he did, then the amount of added sugar he consumed from those sources would also need to be subtracted from the total daily recommended intake."}

Then, according to the problem, Jenny ate 5 more than thrice the number of chocolate squares that Mike ate, which means she ate 5 + 3x chocolate squares.\n\nWe know that Jenny has a tummy ache, so we can infer that she ate more chocolate squares than Mike. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n\n5 + 3x > x\n\nTo solve for x, we can first subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:\n\n3x > x - 5\n\nNow, we can simplify the equation by combining like terms:\n\n2x > -4\n\nNext, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2 to get:\n\nx > -2\n\nFinally, we can conclude that Mike ate x = 2 chocolate squares, since Jenny ate 5 more than thrice the number of chocolate squares that Mike ate.\n\nTherefore, Jenny ate 5 + 3(2) = 5 + 6 = 11 chocolate squares.\n\nSo, Jenny ate 11 - 2 = 9 more chocolate squares than her brother Mike."}

If 2/5 of the quarters are state quarters, then we can multiply the total number of quarters by 2/5:\n\n35 quarters x 2/5 = 14 state quarters\n\n2. Now, we need to find out how many of those state quarters are Pennsylvania quarters. We know that 50% of the state quarters are Pennsylvania quarters. To find 50% of 14, we can multiply 14 by 0.5:\n\n14 state quarters x 0.5 = 7 Pennsylvania quarters\n\n3. So, Nick has 7 Pennsylvania quarters out of a total of 35 quarters. To find the total number of quarters, we can subtract the number of Pennsylvania quarters from the total number of quarters:\n\n35 quarters - 7 Pennsylvania quarters = 28 quarters\n\nTherefore, Nick has 28 quarters."}

[/INST]  To find the total length of the rope that Tony has collected, we need to add up the lengths of all the individual ropes. We can do this by using the formula:\n\nTotal Length = 8 + 20 + 3(2) + 7\n\nwhere 3(2) represents the sum of the three 2-foot ropes, which is 6 feet.\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nTotal Length = 8 + 20 + 6 + 7\nTotal Length = 35 feet\n\nHowever, we know that each knot between the ropes makes Tony lose 1.2 feet. Since there are a total of 4 knots (one between each rope), Tony loses a total of 4 x 1.2 = 4.8 feet.\n\nTherefore, the final length of the rope that Tony has after tying all the ropes together is:\n\nFinal Length = Total Length - Length Lost Due to Knots\nFinal Length = 35 - 4.8\nFinal Length = 30.2 feet\n\nSo, the longest rope that Tony can make with the ropes he has collected is 30.2 feet long."}

Nina used 720 grams of sugar to bake everything.\n5. Since each cupcake takes 60 grams of sugar, we can calculate the total amount of sugar used for the cupcakes by multiplying the number of cupcakes by the amount of sugar per cupcake: 12 cupcakes x 60 grams/cupcake = 720 grams.\n6. Since the cake and cupcakes use the same amount of sugar, we can equate the amount of sugar used for the cake to the number of cupcakes: 24 cupcakes worth of sugar = 720 grams.\n7. Now, we can solve for the amount of sugar used for each cupcake: 720 grams / 24 cupcakes = 30 grams/cupcake.\n8. Finally, we can calculate the amount of sugar used for the cake by multiplying the number of layers by the amount of sugar per layer: 2 layers x 30 grams/layer = 60 grams.\n\nTherefore, Nina used 60 grams of sugar to bake the two-layer cake, and 720 - 60 = 660 grams of sugar to bake the dozen cupcakes."}

Max's maximum daily performance = 35 packages\n2. Max delivered the maximum number of packages twice = 2 days with 35 packages each = 70 packages\n3. Total packages delivered in a week = 70 + 50 + 1/7 \\* 35 + 2/5 \\* 35 = 180 packages\n4.

Therefore, Max delivered 35 packages on two days and fewer packages on the other three days.\n\nNow, let's find the minimum number of packages Max delivered on the three days he didn't deliver the maximum:\n\n1.

When Mandy was 6 years old, she started reading books with 8 pages.\n2. By the time she was 12 years old (twice the age of 6), she was reading books that were 5 times longer, meaning each book had 5 \\* 8 = 40 pages.\n3. Eight years later, when Mandy was 20 years old, she was reading books that were 3 times longer than the previous length. So, each book had 3 \\* 40 = 120 pages.\n4. Presently, Mandy reads books that are 4 times the previous length. So, each book has 4 \\* 120 = 480 pages.\n\nNow, we can work backward to find the number of pages in the books Mandy read when she was 6 years old:\n\n480 pages (present) / 4 (multiplier) = 120 pages (at age 20)\n120 pages / 3 (multiplier) = 40 pages (at age 12)\n40 pages / 5 (multiplier) = 8 pages (at age 6)\n\nTherefore, the books Mandy read when she was 6 years old had 8 pages."}

The total weight of the dog food is not given, but we can calculate it based on the above information.\n\nNow, let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. Calculate the total weight of the cat food:\n2 bags x 3 pounds/bag = 2 x 48 ounces = 96 ounces\n2. Calculate the total weight of the dog food:\n2 bags x 2 pounds/bag = 2 x 48 ounces = 96 ounces\n3. Since the dog food weighs 2 more pounds than the cat food, we can subtract the weight of the cat food from the weight of the dog food to find the weight of the dog food:\n96 ounces - 96 ounces = 0 ounces (this means the dog food weighs the same as the cat food)\n4. Since the dog food weighs the same as the cat food, Mrs. Anderson must have bought the same number of bags of dog food as she bought bags of cat food. Therefore, the number of bags of cat food she bought is also the number of bags of dog food she bought.\n5. Therefore, Mrs. Anderson bought 2 bags of cat food and 2 bags of dog food.\n\nSo, the answer to the question is:\nMrs. Anderson bought 2 bags of cat food."}

[/INST]  To solve this problem, we need to find the number of wild animals the small zoo houses before and after the changes, and then find the difference between the two numbers.\n\nLet's start by identifying the information given in the problem:\n\n* The small zoo houses a variety of 68 wild animals.\n* They send a gorilla family of six to a different zoo.\n* They adopt a hippopotamus from another zoo.\n* An animal rescue contacted them, and the zoo took in three endangered rhinos.\n* One of their lionesses gave birth to cubs.\n* They opened a meerkat exhibit with twice as many meerkats as they had gained lion cubs.\n* The zoo then had 90 animals in all.\n\nNow, let's think about how these changes affect the number of wild animals in the zoo:\n\n1. The gorilla family of six is sent to a different zoo, so the number of wild animals in the small zoo decreases by six.\n2. The hippopotamus is adopted from another zoo, so the number of wild animals in the small zoo increases by one.\n3. The three endangered rhinos are taken in by the zoo, so the number of wild animals in the small zoo increases by three.\n4. One of the lionesses gives birth to cubs, so the number of wild animals in the small zoo increases by the number of cubs born.\n5. The meerkat exhibit is opened with twice as many meerkats as the number of lion cubs, so the number of wild animals in the small zoo increases by twice the number of lion cubs.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of wild animals in the small zoo before and after the changes:\n\nBefore the changes:\nThe small zoo houses 68 wild animals.\n\nAfter the changes:\nThe small zoo houses 90 animals in all, including the meerkats.\n\nSo, the number of wild animals in the small zoo increases by 22 animals (90 - 68).\n\nNow, we can answer the question: The small zoo houses 68 + 22 = 90 wild animals."}

This means that the charging rate must have been constant over those 45 minutes, otherwise the phone would not have reached a consistent 25% charge.\n\nWe can use the formula:\n\nTime = (Charge / Charging Rate)\n\nWhere:\n\n* Time is the time it took to charge the phone\n* Charge is the amount of charge the phone has (in this case, 25%)\n* Charging Rate is the rate at which the phone charges per minute (which we assume is constant)\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for Time, we get:\n\nTime = (25% / Charging Rate)\n\nWe don't know the charging rate, so we can't plug in a value for it. However, we can set up a proportion to compare the charging rate to the time:\n\n(25% / Charging Rate) = (45 minutes / Time)\n\nThis proportion states that the time it took to charge the phone is equal to the charging rate multiplied by the time it took to charge the phone, divided by the amount of charge the phone has.\n\nNow we can solve for Time by cross-multiplying and simplifying:\n\nTime = (45 minutes \\* Charging Rate) / 25%\n\nNow we need to find the charging rate. We know that the phone was charged for 45 minutes, so we can set up a proportion to compare the charging rate to the time:\n\n(45 minutes / Charging Rate) = Time\n\nSolving for Charging Rate, we get:\n\nCharging Rate = 45 minutes / Time\n\nNow we can substitute this expression for Charging Rate into the first equation:\n\nTime = (25% / (45 minutes / Time))\n\nSimplifying and solving"}

His hourly wage is $25, so his monthly income is:\n\nMonthly income = Hourly wage x Number of hours worked per month\n= $25/hour x 120 hours/month\n= $3,000/month\n\nNow, we can calculate the amount of government assistance Bill will receive based on his income. The government will pay:\n\n* 90% of the plan's cost if Bill's income is less than $10,000\n* 50% of the plan's cost if Bill's income is between $10,001 and $40,000\n* 20% of the plan's cost if Bill's income is more than $50,000\n\nSince Bill's monthly income is $3,000, which is between $10,001 and $40,000, the government will pay 50% of the plan's cost.\n\nTherefore, the normal monthly price of the plan Bill wants is:\n\nNormal monthly price = Plan's cost x (1 - Government assistance percentage)\n= $500 x (1 - 0.5)\n= $500 x 0.5\n= $250\n\nSo, the normal monthly price of the plan Bill wants is $250. However, since Bill's income is between $10,001 and $40,000, he will receive a subsidy from the government that covers 50% of the plan's cost, leaving him with a net cost of $250."}

Finally, on Friday it rained for half the day and she managed to pull up 10 fewer weeds than she did on Thursday. How many weeds did she pull on Tuesday? [/INST]  Let's start by using the information given in the problem to create a sequence of equations:\n\nTuesday: 25 weeds\nWednesday: 3 times the number of weeds on Tuesday = 3(25) = 75 weeds\nThursday: one-fifth the number of weeds on Wednesday = 1/5(75) = 15 weeds\nFriday: 10 fewer weeds than on Thursday = 15 - 10 = 5 weeds\n\nNow, we can solve this system of equations by substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution. Solving the first equation for Tuesday's weeds, we get:\n\n25 = 3(75)\n\nNow, substitute this expression for Tuesday's weeds into the equation for Thursday's weeds:\n\n15 = 1/5(75)\n\nSolve for 75:\n\n75 = 5(15)\n75 = 75\n\nGreat!

At the end of the year, he gets a windfall that is worth 50% more than what he has in his bank account.\n\nWe can start by calculating the total amount of money James has in his bank account at the end of the year:\n\nTotal amount = $250,000 + ($2000 x 52 weeks)\nTotal amount = $250,000 + $104,000\nTotal amount = $354,000\n\nNow, we know that the windfall James gets is 50% more than what he has in his bank account. So, the windfall is 50% of $354,000, which is:\n\nWindfall = $354,000 x 0.5\nWindfall = $177,000\n\nNow, we can calculate the total amount of money James has after receiving the windfall:\n\nNew total = $354,000 + $177,000\nNew total = $531,000\n\nSince James invests $2000 a week, we can calculate the number of weeks it would take him to save the new total amount:\n\nNumber of weeks = $531,000 / $2000\nNumber of weeks = 265.5 weeks\n\nSo, James invests $2000 a week into his bank account for 265.5 weeks to save the total amount of $531,000, including the windfall he received at the end of the year."}

Since each piglet must grow for at least 12 months before it can be sold, the farmer will need to feed each piglet for 12 months before it can be sold. Therefore, the total cost of feeding each piglet until it is sold is:\n\n$10/month x 12 months = $120\n\nSince the farmer can sell a fully grown pig for $300, the profit from selling a piglet that has been fed for 12 months is:\n\n$300 - $120 = $180\n\nNow, let's think about how many piglets the farmer can raise and sell in one year. Since each piglet must grow for at least 12 months before it can be sold, the farmer can only raise and sell one batch of piglets per year.

The total cost of feeding these x piglets for 12 months is:\n\n$10/month x 12 months x x piglets = $120x\n\nThe total profit from selling these x piglets is:\n\n$300 x x piglets - $120x = $180x\n\nNow, let's set up an equation based on the above information:\n\n$180x = $120x + $180\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = 6\n\nTherefore, the far"}

Let's start by using the information given in the problem to find the number of followers Susy has after each week:\n\n* Week 1: Susy has 100 followers and gains 40 new followers, so she has a total of 100 + 40 = 140 followers.\n* Week 2: Susy has 140 followers and gains half of 40 new followers, which is 20, so she has a total of 140 + 20 = 160 followers.\n* Week 3: Susy has 160 followers and gains half of 20 new followers, which is 10, so she has a total of 160 + 10 = 170 followers.\n\nNow, let's use the information about Sarah's followers to find the number of students in the smaller school that Sarah attends. Sarah has 50 followers at the start of the year, and she gains 90 new followers in the first week. So, after the first week, Sarah has a total of 50 + 90 = 140 followers.\n\nIn the second week, Sarah gains a third of 90 new followers, which is 30.

[/INST]  Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem:\n\n* Issac buys 108 writing utensils total.\n* He buys 12 more than 5 times the number of pencils than pens.\n\nWe can start by using the fact that Issac buys 12 more than 5 times the number of pencils than pens to write an equation. Let's say the number of pencils is \"p\" and the number of pens is \"q\". Then, we can write:\n\nq = 5p + 12\n\nWe also know that the total number of writing utensils is 108, so we can write:\n\np + q = 108\n\nNow we need to solve the system of equations. We can start by substituting the expression for \"q\" into the equation for the total number of writing utensils:\n\np + (5p + 12) = 108\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n6p + 12 = 108\n\nSubtract 12 from both sides:\n\n6p = 96\n\nDivide by 6:\n\np = 16\n\nNow we know the number of pencils is 16.

We know that the remaining ducklings each find half the number of snails that the mother duck finds. So, if the mother duck finds x snails, then the remaining ducklings will find x/2 snails each.\n\nWe know that the total number of snails that all the ducklings find is equal to the number of snails that the mother duck finds plus the number of snails that the first 3 ducklings find plus the number of snails that the next 3 ducklings find:\n\nx + 15 + 27 = 8x\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\nx + 42 = 8x\n\nSubtracting x from both sides gives us:\n\n42 = 7x\n\nDividing both sides by 7 gives us:\n\n6 = x\n\nSo, the mother duck finds 6 snails.\n\nFinally, we can find the number of ducklings that the mother duck has by subtracting the number of snails that the first 3 ducklings find from the number of snails that the mother duck finds:\n\n6 - 15 = -9\n\nThis means that the mother duck has 9 ducklings.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the problem is:\n\nThe mother duck has 9 ducklings."}

Therefore, the total number of cards in a deck without jokers and blank cards is:\n\n4 suits x 13 cards per suit = 52 cards\n\nNow, let's add the jokers and blank cards to the deck:\n\n52 cards + 2 jokers + 2 blank cards = 55 cards\n\nSince James can tear 30 cards at a time, we can calculate the number of card packs he can tear in one week:\n\n30 cards per tear x 3 tears per week = 90 cards per week\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of weeks it would take James to tear the entire deck:\n\n55 cards in the deck \u00f7 90 cards per week = 0.61 weeks\n\nTo find out how many cards James can tear at a time, we can divide the total number of cards in the deck by the number of weeks it would take him to tear the entire deck:\n\n55 cards \u00f7 0.61 weeks = 90.1 cards per week\n\nRounding up to the nearest whole number, James can tear approximately 91 cards at a time."}
{"ground truth": 125.0, "prediction": "[INST] Todd bought a pair of jeans that cost $125 at full price. The jeans were on sale for 20% off. He then applied a coupon that took off $10. He paid with a store credit card that gave him another 10% off the remaining amount. How much did Todd's pair of jeans cost at full price? [/INST]  To find the full price of the jeans, we need to reverse the discounts and deductions that Todd received. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Todd used a store credit card that gave him 10% off the remaining amount. This means that the remaining amount after the previous discounts was 90% of the full price.\n2. Todd had a coupon that took off $10. This means that the price before the coupon was $125 - $10 = $115.\n3. The jeans were on sale for 20% off. This means that the original price was reduced by 20%, so the sale price was 80% of the full price.\n\nNow, let's find 80% of the full price:\n\n80% of $125 = 0.8 \u00d7 $125 = $100\n\nSo, the jeans cost $100 before the 20% discount.\n\nNow, let's find 90% of $100:\n\n90% of $100 = 0.9 \u00d7 $100 = $90\n\nThis means that the price before the coupon was $90.\n\nFinally, let's add the $10 coupon discount to find the full price:\n\n$90 - $10 = $80\n\nTherefore, Todd's pair of jeans cost $80 at full price."}

Let's assume that the books Jenny wants to read have an average of 35,000 words.\n\nTo find out how many books Jenny can read in 10 days, we can divide the total number of words she can read (24,000) by the number of words in a book (35,000):\n\n24,000 words / 35,000 words per book = 0.69 books\n\nSince you can't read a fraction of a book, we can round up to the nearest whole number. In this case, Jenny can read approximately 1 book in the next 10 days."}

Ann slides down a hill that's 800 feet long at a rate of 40 feet/minute. How long is the hill that Mary slides down? [/INST]  To find the length of the hill that Mary slides down, we can use the formula:\n\nDistance = Speed x Time\n\nWe know that Mary's speed is 90 feet/minute, so we need to find the time it takes her to slide down the hill. We can do this by dividing the distance by her speed:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n\nWe know that the distance is 630 feet, so we can plug this value into the equation:\n\nTime = 630 feet / 90 feet/minute\n\nTime = 7 minutes\n\nNow that we know the time it takes Mary to slide down the hill, we can use the formula:\n\nDistance = Speed x Time\n\nto find the length of the hill:\n\nDistance = 90 feet/minute x 7 minutes\n\nDistance = 630 feet\n\nTherefore, the length of the hill that Mary slides down is 630 feet."}

[/INST]  Okay, let's break this down step by step!\n\nFirst, Caroline has 40 pairs of socks.\n\nThen, she loses 4 pairs of socks at the laundromat, so she has 36 pairs of socks left.\n\nNext, she donates two-thirds of her remaining socks to the thrift store. Two-thirds of 36 is 24, so she donates 24 pairs of socks.\n\nNow, she has 36 - 24 = 12 pairs of socks left.\n\nThen, she purchases 10 new pairs of socks, so she has 12 + 10 = 22 pairs of socks now.\n\nFinally, her dad gives her 3 new pairs of socks as a gift, so she has 22 + 3 = 25 pairs of socks in total.\n\nTherefore, Caroline has 25 pairs of socks after all of these events."}

What is the percentage difference between the number of redwoods and the number of pines in the national park? [/INST]  To find the percentage difference between the number of redwoods and the number of pines in the national park, we need to first find the number of redwoods and the number of pines.\n\nLet's say the number of pines in the national park is x. Then, the number of redwoods is 20% more than the number of pines, so the number of redwoods is 1.2x.\n\nThe percentage difference between the number of redwoods and the number of pines is:\n\n(1.2x - x) / x = 0.2x\n\nNow, we need to find the percentage that 0.2x represents. To do this, we can multiply 0.2x by 100:\n\n0.2x \u00d7 100 = 20\n\nSo, the percentage difference between the number of redwoods and the number of pines in the national park is 20%."}

Later on, he lost 6 of the red balls, so he decided to buy some yellow balls to fill up his collection. How many red balls did he have? [/INST]  To solve this problem, we can start by using the information that Jamie had 16 red balls and twice as many blue balls. This means that the number of blue balls is 2x, where x is the number of red balls.\n\nWe know that Jamie lost 6 red balls, so now he has 16 - 6 = 10 red balls.\n\nThe number of blue balls is still twice the number of red balls, so the number of blue balls is 2x, where x is 10.\n\nTo find the number of yellow balls that Jamie needs to buy, we can use the fact that the total number of balls in Jamie's collection is equal to the sum of the number of red, blue, and yellow balls.\n\nLet's use R to represent the number of red balls, B to represent the number of blue balls, and Y to represent the number of yellow balls.\n\nWe know that R + B + Y = 16, because Jamie had 16 red balls to start with.\n\nWe also know that B = 2R, because Jamie had twice as many blue balls as red balls.\n\nNow, we can substitute the expression for B (2R) into the first equation:\n\nR + 2R + Y = 16\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n3R + Y = 16\n\nSubtract 10 from both sides (since Jamie lost 6 red balls):\n\n3R + Y = 6\n\nNow, we can solve for Y (the number of yellow balls Jamie needs to buy):\n\nY = 6 - 3R\n\nWe know that R = 10, so substitute this value into the equation:\n\nY = 6 - 3(10)\nY = 6 - 30\nY = -24\n\nThis means that Jamie needs to buy 24 yellow balls to fill up his collection."}

Silver costs $20 per ounce.\n4. Gold is 50 times more expensive per ounce.\n\nNow, let's assume John buys x ounces of gold. Since he buys twice as much gold, he buys 2x ounces of gold.\n\nWe know that gold is 50 times more expensive per ounce, so the cost of one ounce of gold is 50 times the cost of one ounce of silver.

[/INST]  Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem:\n\n* The dinner bill for 6 friends came to $150.\n* Silas said he would pay for half of the bill.\n* The remaining friends could split the rest of the bill and leave a 10% tip for the whole meal.\n\nNow, let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. First, we know that Silas paid for half of the bill, which means the total bill was $150 / 2 = $75.\n2. Since Silas paid for half of the bill, the remaining friends need to split the other half, which is $75 / 6 = $12.50 per person.\n3. However, the problem states that the friends could split the rest of the bill and leave a 10% tip for the whole meal. This means that the total amount each friend needs to pay is $12.50 + (10% of $12.50) = $12.50 + $1.25 = $13.75 per person.\n4. Therefore, there were 6 friends for the dinner bill that came to $150.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\nThere were 6 friends for the dinner bill that came to $150."}

How many flowers are there in the garden? [/INST]  Let's start by using the information that there are twice as many red flowers as orange flowers. So, if there are x orange flowers, there are 2x red flowers.\n\nWe also know that there are five fewer yellow flowers than red flowers. So, if there are y yellow flowers, there are y + 5 red flowers.\n\nFinally, we know that the total number of flowers in the garden is 105. So, we can set up the following equation:\n\nx + 2x + y + (y + 5) = 105\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n3x + 2y + 5 = 105\n\nNow, solve for x and y:\n\n3x = 105 - 2y - 5\n3x = 100 - 2y\nx = 33 - 2y/3\n\nNow, substitute this expression for x into the equation for y:\n2y + 5 = 105 - 33 + 2y/3\n2y + 5 = 74\n2y = 69\ny = 34\n\nNow that we have found x and y, we can find the total number of flowers:\n\nTotal flowers = x + y + 5\nTotal flowers = 33 + 34 + 5\nTotal flowers = 72\n\nThere are 72 flowers in the garden."}
{"ground truth": 35000.0, "prediction": "[INST] Mike wants to buy a new car. He has chosen a red car for $35000. To be able to pay this price, he needs to loan part of the money from the bank, at a rate of 15%. How much did he pay for the red car? [/INST]  To calculate the amount that Mike paid for the red car, we need to know the amount of the loan he took out and the interest he paid on that loan. We can use the formula for the total cost of a loan, which is:\n\nTotal Cost = (Loan Amount x Interest Rate) + Loan Amount\n\nIn this case, the loan amount is the portion of the car's price that Mike borrowed from the bank, and the interest rate is 15%.\n\nLet's assume that Mike borrowed $25,000 from the bank to buy the red car. The total cost of the loan would be:\n\nTotal Cost = ($25,000 x 15%) + $25,000\nTotal Cost = $3750 + $25,000\nTotal Cost = $28,750\n\nSo, Mike paid a total of $28,750 for the red car, which includes the loan amount of $25,000 and the interest paid of $3,750. The original price of the car was $35,000, but Mike only had to pay $28,750 because he borrowed part of the money from the bank."}

We can do this by multiplying the number of hours she works per week by her hourly wage.\n\nMila works 8 hours per week, so her weekly earnings are:\n\nMila's weekly earnings = 8 hours/week x $10/hour = $80/week\n\nNow, we can compare Mila's weekly earnings to Agnes' weekly earnings to find out how much Mila makes per hour. Agnes makes $15/hour and works 8 hours/week, so her weekly earnings are:\n\nAgnes' weekly earnings = 8 hours/week x $15/hour = $120/week\n\nSince Mila makes $80/week and Agnes makes $120/week, we can set up a proportion to find out how much Mila makes per hour:\n\nMila's weekly earnings / Agnes' weekly earnings = Mila's hourly wage / Agnes' hourly wage\n\n$80/week / $120/week = $10/hour / $15/hour\n\nNow, we can cross-multiply and simplify:\n\n$80/week x $15/hour = $120/week x $10/hour\n\n$1200/week = $1200/week\n\nSince the hours per week are the same for both babysitters, we can cancel them out:\n\n$10/hour = $15/hour - $3/hour\n\n$10/hour = $12/hour\n\nTherefore, Mila makes $12/hour."}

Since William will take the exam on Tuesday, his score is not included in the total score yet.\n\nIf the class wants to have a pizza party, the average score must be at least 75%. This means that the total score must be at least 75% of n.\n\nLet's call the total score without William's score \"T\". T = (75% of n) - William's score\n\nSince William's score is not included in the total score yet, we can substitute T = (75% of n) - 0, since William's score is 0 for now.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\nT = (75% of n) - 0\n\nSimplifying, we get:\nT = 0.75n\n\nNow, we need to find the minimum average percentage the class needs to score to have a pizza party. Let's call this percentage \"p\".\n\nWe know that the class needs to average at least 75% to have a pizza party, so:\np \u2265 0.75\n\nSubstituting p = 0.75, we get:\nT = 0.75n \u2265 0.75(n-1) + 1\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n0.75n \u2265 0.75(n-1) + 1\n\nSubtracting 0.75(n-1) from both sides gives:\n0.75n - 0.75(n-1) \u2265 1\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n0.75n - 0.75n + 0.75 \u2265 1\n\nSubtracting 0.75n from both sides gives:\n-0.75n + 0.75 \u2265 1\n\nSubtracting 0.75 from both sides"}

[/INST]  To find out how many eggs Addilynn accidentally broke while moving them to clean the shelves, we need to first find out how many eggs she had left after using half of the eggs.\n\nAfter two weeks, Addilynn used half of the eggs, which means she used 6 dozen eggs / 2 = 3 dozen eggs.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many eggs are in 3 dozen. There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so 3 dozen is equal to 3 x 12 = 36 eggs.\n\nNow, let's find out how many eggs Addilynn accidentally broke while moving them to clean the shelves. The problem states that she accidentally broke 15 eggs. Since she had 36 eggs left, we can find out how many eggs she broke by subtracting the number of eggs she broke from the total number of eggs she had:\n\n36 eggs - 15 eggs = 21 eggs\n\nTherefore, Addilynn accidentally broke 15 eggs while moving them to clean the shelves."}

So, if he has x Alien Baseball cards, he has 2x Monster Club cards.\n\nWe also know that his Battle Gremlins card collection is three times the size of his Alien Baseball card collection, so we can write:\n\nBattle Gremlins = 3(Alien Baseball)\n\nNow, we can substitute the expression we derived for Monster Club cards:\n\nBattle Gremlins = 3(2x)\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nBattle Gremlins = 6x\n\nSo, Oliver's Battle Gremlins card collection has 6x cards. To find the actual number of cards, we need to know what x represents. We know that x is the number of Alien Baseball cards, so we can substitute the value of x into the expression for Battle Gremlins:\n\nBattle Gremlins = 6x\n\nIf Oliver has 24 Alien Baseball cards, then x = 24.

{"ground truth": 500.0, "prediction": "[INST] Carson is refilling his tires. Each tire can hold 500 cubic inches of air. Two of the tires are completely flat and empty. One tire is 40% full and the last tire is 70% full. How much air can each tire hold? [/INST]  To find out how much air each tire can hold, we need to calculate the volume of air that each tire can hold, based on its current level of inflation.\n\n1. The two flat tires can hold 500 cubic inches of air each, since they are completely empty. So, the total volume of air that these two tires can hold is 2 x 500 = 1000 cubic inches.\n2. The tire that is 40% full is partially inflated, so we need to calculate the volume of air it can hold based on its current level of inflation. To do this, we can use the formula:\n\nVolume = (Percent full) / 100 x Total volume\n\nIn this case, the total volume of the tire is 500 cubic inches, and it is 40% full, so:\n\nVolume = (40) / 100 x 500 = 200 cubic inches\n\nSo, the third tire can hold 200 cubic inches of air.\n3. The last tire is 70% full, so we can use the same formula to calculate the volume of air it can hold:\n\nVolume = (70) / 100 x 500 = 350 cubic inches\n\nSo, the last tire can hold 350 cubic inches of air.\n\nTherefore, the total volume of air that all four tires can hold is:\n\n1000 (flat tires) + 200 (40% full tire) + 350 (70% full tire) = 1550 cubic inches."}

Since he picks 7 peppers on Sunday, we can assume that 7/15 of the peppers he picked on Sunday are hot:\n\n7/15 = 0.466...

How many dressed chickens did Foster Farms donate? [/INST]  Let's start by using the information that Hormel donated three times the number of dressed chickens that Foster Farms donated. So, if Foster Farms donated x dressed chickens, Hormel donated 3x dressed chickens.\n\nWe also know that Boudin Butchers donated one-third of the number of dressed chickens that Hormel donated, so Boudin Butchers donated 3x/3 = x dressed chickens.\n\nAmerican Summits donated twice the number of bottled water than the number of dressed chickens donated by Foster Farms, so if Foster Farms donated x dressed chickens, American Summits donated 2x bottles of water.\n\nDel Monte Foods donated 30 fewer bottles of water than American Summits, so Del Monte Foods donated 2x - 30 bottles of water.\n\nNow, we can set up a system of linear equations using these equations:\n\n1. Hormel donated 3x dressed chickens\n2. Boudin Butchers donated x dressed chickens\n3. American Summits donated 2x bottles of water\n4. Del Monte Foods donated 2x - 30 bottles of water\n\nWe can solve this system of equations by substituting the equations into each other.

[/INST]  Let's start by using the information that Sebastian is 4 years older than Jeremy to find their current ages.\n\nLet Jeremy's current age be J. Then, Sebastian's current age is J + 4, and Sophia's current age is S.\n\nWe know that the sum of their ages in three years will be 150, so we can write an equation:\n\nJ + (J + 4) + S = 150\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n2J + 4 + S = 150\n\nNow, we can substitute the values we know. Let's say Jeremy's current age is 25, which means Sebastian's current age is 29 (25 + 4). Sophia's current age is 30.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n2(25) + 4 + 30 = 150\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n50 + 4 + 30 = 150\n\n54 + 30 = 150\n\n84 = 150\n\nThis equation is not true, so our initial assumption that Jeremy's age is 25 must be false.\n\nLet's try again, assuming that Jeremy's current age is 20. Then, Sebastian's current age is 24 (20 + 4), and Sophia's current age is still 30.\n\nThe equation becomes:\n\n2(20) + 4 + 30 = 150\n\n40 + 4 + 30 = 150\n\n74 = 150\n\nThis equation is true, so we can conclude that Jeremy's current age is 20, Sebastian's current age is 24, and Sophia's current age is 30.\n\nIn three years, Jeremy's age will be 23, Sebastian's age will be 27, and Sophia's age will still be 30.\n\nThe sum of their ages in three years will be:\n\n23 + 27 + 30 = 80\n\nSo, the sum of the ages of Jer"}

Since they drove for 1 hour, their speed can be calculated as:\n\n Speed = d / 1 hour\n\nWe know that they drove 1/4 of the total distance, so:\n\nd = 200 / 4 = 50 miles\n\nTherefore, their speed is:\n\nSpeed = 50 / 1 = 50 miles per hour\n\nSince they took lunch for another 1 hour, the total time they spent driving is:\n\nTotal time = 1 hour (before lunch) + 1 hour (after lunch) = 2 hours\n\nThe remaining distance they need to drive is:\n\nRemaining distance = 200 - 50 = 150 miles\n\nWe can calculate the time it took them to drive the remaining distance by dividing the remaining distance by their speed:\n\nTime = remaining distance / speed = 150 / 50 = 3 hours\n\nSince the total time they spent driving is 2 hours, we can see that they drove for 1 hour before lunch and 3 hours after lunch.\n\nTherefore, the number of towns between which the total distance is 200 miles is 2."}
{"ground truth": 80.0, "prediction": "[INST] Josie and her family went on a safari and had an exciting time watching different animals grazing and playing together. She decided to count each animal she saw and calculated their total number. She counted 80 antelopes, 34 more rabbits than antelopes, 42 fewer hyenas than the total number of antelopes and rabbits combined, 50 more wild dogs than hyenas, and the number of leopards was half the number of rabbits. How many antelopes did she count? [/INST]  Let's start by using the information we know to create equations:\n\n1. Total number of antelopes = 80\n2. Number of rabbits = 80 + 34 = 114\n3. Number of hyenas = 80 + 42 = 122\n4. Number of wild dogs = 122 + 50 = 172\n5. Number of leopards = 114/2 = 57\n\nNow, we can use these equations to find the number of antelopes:\n\n1. 80 = 114 - 34\n2. 114 = 122 - 42\n3. 122 = 172 - 50\n4. 114 = 57 x 2\n\nSolving these equations, we get:\n\n1. 80 = 80 - 34\n2. 114 = 80 + 34\n3. 122 = 80 + 42\n4. 114 = 57 x 2\n\nTherefore, Josie counted 80 antelopes on the safari."}

[/INST]  To find out how many one-hour videos of food reviews Allison uploads to her channel each day, we need to calculate the total number of hours she uploaded in June and then divide that number by 30 (the number of days in June).\n\nLet's first calculate the total number of hours Allison uploaded in June:\n\n1. Halfway through June, she uploaded 10 one-hour videos per day, so she uploaded a total of 10 x 15 (half of 30) = 150 hours of food reviews in June.\n2. In the remaining days of June, she doubled the number of video hours she uploaded, so she uploaded 2 x 10 = 20 hours of food reviews per day.\n3. Since there are 15 days remaining in June (after the 15th), she uploaded a total of 20 x 15 = 300 hours of food reviews in the remaining days.\n\nNow, let's add up the total number of hours Allison uploaded in June:\n\n150 (halfway through June) + 300 (remaining days) = 450 hours\n\nNow, we divide the total number of hours by 30 (the number of days in June) to find out how many one-hour videos of food reviews Allison uploads to her channel each day:\n\n450 hours \u00f7 30 days = 15 hours per day\n\nSo, Allison uploads 15 hours of food reviews to her channel each day."}

Each truck can carry a load of no more than 2,000 pounds of cargo. Some of the boxes weigh 10 pounds after being packed, and some of the boxes weigh 40 pounds when packed. Steven\u2019s customer has ordered equal quantities of both the lighter and heavier products. What is the maximum number of pounds of cargo that each truck can carry? [/INST]  To determine the maximum amount of cargo that each truck can carry, we need to use the information given in the problem.\n\nLet's start by summarizing the information we have:\n\n* Each truck can carry a maximum load of 2,000 pounds.\n* There are two types of boxes: lighter boxes that weigh 10 pounds each and heavier boxes that weigh 40 pounds each.\n* The customer has ordered equal quantities of both types of products.\n\nNow, let's think about how we can use this information to determine the maximum amount of cargo that each truck can carry. Since the customer has ordered equal quantities of both types of products, we can assume that the number of lighter boxes and the number of heavier boxes are equal. Let's call this number \"x\".\n\nSo, the total weight of the lighter boxes is 10x pounds, and the total weight of the heavier boxes is 40x pounds.\n\nSince each truck can carry a maximum load of 2,000 pounds, we can say that the total weight of the cargo on each truck must be less than or equal to 2,000 pounds.\n\nTherefore, we can set up the following inequality:\n\n10x + 40x <= 2000\n\nSimplifying the inequality, we get:\n\n50x <= 2000\n\nDividing both sides by 50, we get:\n\nx <= 40\n\nSince x is a positive integer, we can round down to the nearest integer. Therefore, the maximum number of pounds that each truck can carry is 40 pounds.\n\nSo, the answer to the question is 40 pounds."}

The problem can be solved using a sequence of equations, where each equation represents a bounce of the ball.\n\nLet's assume that the ball bounces n times before it reaches the ground. We can represent the height of the ball after each bounce as follows:\n\n* H1 = 96 feet (initial height)\n* H2 = H1/2 = 48 feet (first bounce)\n* H3 = H2/2 = 24 feet (second bounce)\n* ...\n* Hn = H(n-1)/2 = 0 feet (last bounce, ball reaches the ground)\n\nWe know that after n bounces, the ball reaches the ground, so we can set up the equation:\n\nHn = 0\n\nSubstituting Hn = 0, we get:\n\nH(n-1)/2 = 0\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2, we get:\n\nH(n-1) = 0\n\nNow, we can substitute H(n-1) = 0 into the equation for H2:\n\nH2 = H1/2 = 48 feet\n\nSubstituting 48 feet for H2, we get:\n\nH1 = 2 \\* H2 = 2 \\* 48 feet = 96 feet\n\nTherefore, the building from which Tim drops the ball is 96 feet tall.\n\nAnswer: The building is 96 feet tall."}

How much does a small cup of lemonade cost at Tonya's lemonade stand? [/INST]  Let's start by using the information that Tonya sold $11 worth of small lemonades. Since each small lemonade costs $1, we can set up the equation:\n\n11 = 1 x (number of small lemonades sold)\n\nWe can solve for the number of small lemonades sold by dividing both sides of the equation by $1:\n\nnumber of small lemonades sold = 11 / 1 = 11\n\nNow, we know that Tonya sold 11 small lemonades. Let's use the information that she sold $24 worth of medium lemonades. Since each medium lemonade costs $2, we can set up the equation:\n\n24 = 2 x (number of medium lemonades sold)\n\nWe can solve for the number of medium lemonades sold by dividing both sides of the equation by $2:\n\nnumber of medium lemonades sold = 24 / 2 = 12\n\nNow, we know that Tonya sold 11 small lemonades and 12 medium lemonades. We can use this information to find out how much money Tonya made from each size of lemonade.\n\nSmall lemonades: 11 x $1 = $11\nMedium lemonades: 12 x $2 = $24\n\nNow, we add up the amounts made from each size of lemonade to find Tonya's total earnings:\n\nTotal earnings = $11 + $24 = $35\n\nSince Tonya made $50 in total, we know that she must have also sold some large lemonades. Let's use the information that large lemonades cost $3 each. We can set up the equation:\n\n$50 = $11 + $24 + (number of large lemonades x $3)\n\nWe can solve for the number of large lemonades by dividing both sides of the equation by $3:\n\nnumber of large lemonades = ($50 - $11 - $24) / $3 = 35 / 3 = 12\n\nNow, we know that Tonya sold 11 small lemonades, 12 medium lemonades, and 12 large"}

How many newspapers does John buy? [/INST]  Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. John buys 500 newspapers, so the cost of buying all the newspapers is 500 x $2 = $1000.\n2. Since John sells 80% of the newspapers, he sells 80% of 500 = 400 newspapers.\n3. The price at which John sells the newspapers is $2, so the total revenue from selling the 400 newspapers is 400 x $2 = $800.\n4. John buys the newspapers for 75% less than the price at which he sells them, so he buys them for $2 - (75% of $2) = $2 - $1.50 = $0.50 per newspaper.\n5. Since John buys 500 newspapers, the total cost of buying all the newspapers is 500 x $0.50 = $250.\n6. Now we have the following equation:\n\n$250 = $1000 - $800\n\nSolving for $1000, we get:\n\n$1000 = $250 + $800\n\n$1000 = $1050\n\nSo John buys 500 - 400 = 100 newspapers."}

[/INST]  Let's first calculate how much money Selina receives for her clothes:\n\n3 pairs of pants x $5 each = $15\n5 pairs of shorts x $3 each = $15\nShirts x $4 each = $4x (where x is the number of shirts sold)\n\nTotal amount of money Selina receives = $15 + $15 + $4x\n\nNow, let's find out how much Selina spends on the two shirts:\n\n2 shirts x $10 each = $20\n\nSelina leaves the store with $30, so the amount of money she has left after buying the two shirts must be equal to the amount of money she received for her clothes minus the amount she spent on the shirts:\n\n$30 = Total amount of money Selina receives - $20\n\nNow we can solve for x, the number of shirts sold, in the equation for the total amount of money Selina receives:\n\n$15 + $15 + $4x = $30 + $20\n\n$4x = $10\n\nx = 2\n\nSo, Selina sells 2 shirts for $4 each, and the second-hand store buys her pants for $5 each."}

How many boxes of pizza did the family buy? [/INST]  To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many slices of pizza were not eaten by the family.\n\nIf only three-fourths of the pizza was eaten, that means that one-fourth of the pizza was not eaten.\n\nSince there are 16 slices in a box, one-fourth of the pizza would be 16/4 = 4 slices.\n\nSo, the family did not eat 4 slices of pizza.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many boxes of pizza the family bought. To do this, we can divide the number of slices that were not eaten by the number of slices in a box:\n\n4 slices / 16 slices per box = 0.25 boxes\n\nSince you cannot buy a fraction of a box of pizza, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. In this case, we would round up to 1 box.\n\nTherefore, the family bought 1 box of pizza."}

How many employees does Ms. Estrella's startup company have? [/INST]  To find the number of employees in Ms. Estrella's startup company, we need to use the information provided to first find the net revenue, which is the revenue after taxes and other expenses.\n\n1. First, let's calculate the taxes: 10% of $400,000 is $40,000.\n2. Next, let's calculate the amount spent on marketing and ads: 5% of the remaining amount (($400,000 - $40,000) = $360,000) is $18,000.\n3. Then, we'll calculate the operational costs: 20% of the remaining amount (($360,000 - $18,000) = $344,000) is $68,800.\n4. Finally, we'll calculate the employee wages: 15% of the remaining amount (($344,000 - $68,800) = $319,200) is $47,880.\n\nNow that we have the total monthly expenses, we can find the net revenue by subtracting the total expenses from the total revenue:\n\nNet revenue = Total revenue - Total expenses\nNet revenue = $400,000 - ($40,000 + $18,000 + $68,800 + $47,880)\nNet revenue = $400,000 - $134,680\nNet revenue = $265,320\n\nNow, we can use the net revenue and the employee wages to find the number of employees:\n\nNumber of employees = Net revenue / Employee wages\nNumber of employees = $265,320 / $47,880\nNumber of employees = 5.56\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of employees, we'll round up to the nearest whole number:\n\nNumber of employees = 6\n\nTherefore, Ms. Estrella's startup company has 6 employees."}

Since Elijah needs enough masking tape to cover the entire width of each wall, we need to find the total width of all 4 walls. We can do this by adding the width of the 2 walls that are 4 meters wide and the width of the 2 walls that are 6 meters wide.\n\nThe width of the 2 walls that are 4 meters wide is 2 x 4 meters = 8 meters.\nThe width of the 2 walls that are 6 meters wide is 2 x 6 meters = 12 meters.\n\nAdding these two amounts gives us a total width of:\n8 meters + 12 meters = 20 meters.\n\nSo, the total width of all 4 walls is 20 meters.

She gave away half of the remaining lemonade, which is half of 9 cups = 4.5 cups.\n4. Now, she has 9 - 4.5 = 4.5 cups left.\n5. She drank the last cup of lemonade herself, so she has 4.5 - 1 = 3.5 cups left.\n\nSince she sold 18 cups to kids on bikes, and she has 3.5 cups left, that means she sold 18 - 3.5 = 14.5 cups to kids on bikes.\n\nSo, Hazel sold 14.5 cups of lemonade to kids on bikes."}

How many members does the marching band have? [/INST]  Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. Twice as many woodwinds as brass means that the number of woodwind players is 2x, where x is the number of brass players.\n2. There are 4 times as many percussion players as there are woodwind players, so the number of percussion players is 4(2x) = 8x.\n3. The total number of members in the marching band is the sum of the number of percussion players, woodwind players, and brass players: 8x + 2x + x = 110.\n4. Simplify the equation by combining like terms: 11x = 110.\n5. Divide both sides of the equation by 11 to solve for x: x = 10.\n6. Now that we know x, we can find the number of percussion players (8x = 80), woodwind players (2x = 20), and brass players (x = 10).\n\nSo, the marching band has 80 percussion players, 20 woodwind players, and 10 brass players, for a total of 110 members."}

[/INST]  To find out how many tanks Jennifer built, we need to find the total number of fish that the tanks can hold.\n\nThe first 3 tanks can hold 15 fish each, so they can hold a total of 3 x 15 = 45 fish.\n\nThe rest of the tanks can hold 10 fish each, so they can hold a total of x x 10 = 10x fish, where x is the number of tanks.\n\nSince Jennifer plans to build enough tanks to hold all of her goldfish, the total number of fish that the tanks can hold must be equal to the total number of goldfish she has. Let's say she has n goldfish in total.\n\nSo, we can set up the following equation:\n\n45 + 10x = n\n\nTo solve for x, we can first subtract 45 from both sides of the equation:\n\n10x = n - 45\n\nThen, we can divide both sides of the equation by 10:\n\nx = (n - 45) / 10\n\nNow, we can plug in the values we know:\n\nx = (n - 45) / 10\n\nWe know that n is the total number of goldfish Jennifer has, and we're told that she has 15 fish in each of the first 3 tanks, so n - 45 is the number of fish she has minus the number of fish in the first 3 tanks.\n\nTherefore, we can simplify the equation as follows:\n\nx = (15 x 3) - 45 / 10\n\nx = 45 - 45 / 10\n\nx = 45 - 4.5\n\nx = 40.5\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a tank, we round up to the nearest whole number:\n\nx = 41\n\nTherefore, Jennifer built 41 tanks in total."}

[/INST]  To find the total time it takes for the three girls to run the 600-meter relay race, we need to add up the time it takes each girl to run her portion of the race.\n\nRhonda runs the first 200 meters in 24 seconds, so that's 24 seconds for the first leg of the race.\n\nSally runs the second 200 meters, and she takes two seconds longer than Rhonda to run the same distance. That means Sally runs the second leg of the race in 24 + 2 = 26 seconds.\n\nDiane runs the final 200 meters, and she can run that distance three seconds faster than Rhonda. So, Diane runs the final leg of the race in 24 - 3 = 21 seconds.\n\nTo find the total time it takes for the three girls to run the race, we add up the times for each leg:\n\n24 + 26 + 21 = 71 seconds\n\nSo, the relay race that Rhonda, Sally, and Diane run together takes 71 seconds."}

A 15 ounce bottle of water costs $2. He has $10 with him. How many pounds of sand does Tony's bucket hold? [/INST]  The information given in the problem statement is:\n\n* Tony has a bucket that holds 2 pounds of sand.\n* A cubic foot of sand weighs 3 pounds.\n* Tony wants to make sure he stays hydrated, so every 4 trips he takes he drinks 3 ounces of bottled water.\n* A 15 ounce bottle of water costs $2.\n* Tony has $10 with him.\n\nThe problem is to determine how many pounds of sand Tony's bucket holds.\n\nTo start, we know that a cubic foot of sand weighs 3 pounds, so we can convert the dimensions of the sandbox to cubic feet:\n\n* Depth: 2 feet = 0.25 cubic feet\n* Width: 4 feet = 0.5 cubic feet\n* Length: 5 feet = 0.5 cubic feet\n\nTotal volume of sandbox: 0.25 cubic feet x 0.5 cubic feet x 0.5 cubic feet = 0.125 cubic feet\n\nSince Tony's bucket holds 2 pounds of sand, we know that he can carry 2/3 pounds of sand per trip. Therefore, he can carry 2/3 \\* 0.125 cubic feet = 0.0833 cubic feet of sand per trip.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many trips Tony can make with the $10 he has. We know that a 15 ounce bottle of water costs $2, so 3 ounces of water cost $2/3 = $0.67. Therefore, Tony can afford to buy $10 / $0.67 = 14.9 bottles of water.\n\nSince Tony drinks 3 ounces of water every 4 trips, he can make 14.9 / 4 = 3.73 trips.\n\nTherefore, the total amount of sand that Tony can carry in his bucket is 3.73 trips \\* 0.0833 cubic feet per trip = 0.306 cubic feet.\n\nFinally, we need to convert the volume of sand from cubic feet to pounds.

[/INST]  This is a classic puzzle that plays with the concept of relativity. The answer to the puzzle is that the hallway is 16m long, but the father and son will never meet each other.\n\nThe puzzle is based on the fact that the father and son are approaching each other from opposite ends of the hallway, but they are both moving at the same time. This means that the distance between them is not constant, it's changing every second.\n\nLet's assume that the father is moving towards the son at a speed of 1m/s, and the son is moving towards the father at the same speed. After 1 second, the distance between them will be 15m (16m - 1m). After 2 seconds, the distance between them will be 14m (16m - 2m). And so on.\n\nAs they continue moving towards each other, the distance between them will keep decreasing by 1m every second. However, they will never actually meet each other because the distance between them will always be 1m less than the total length of the hallway.\n\nTherefore, the hallway is 16m long, but the father and son will never meet each other, they will always be 1m apart."}

He then spends a quarter of what is left to buy a new book. How much does James earn per week as an allowance? [/INST]  To solve this problem, we need to use a step-by-step approach, working backwards from the information given in the problem.\n\n1. First, we know that James spends a quarter of what is left after buying the video game to buy a new book. So, let's call the amount of money James has left after buying the video game x.\n2. James spends a quarter of x to buy a new book, so the amount of money James spends on the book is x/4.\n3. We know that James has $10 per week as an allowance, so the total amount of money James has after four weeks is 4 x $10 = $40.\n4. James spends half of the money he has on a new video game, so the amount of money James spends on the video game is $40/2 = $20.\n5. Now, we have the following equation: $40 - $20 = x + x/4, where x is the amount of money James has left after buying the video game.\n6. Simplifying the equation, we get: $20 = 3x/4.\n7. Now, we can solve for x by multiplying both sides by 4: $20 \\* 4 = 3x.\n8. So, x = $80.\n9.

Six of his pets have four legs.\n4. He has 2 dogs.\n\nWe can start by using the information that Frankie has six more snakes than cats to determine the number of snakes he has. Let's assume the number of cats he has is x. Then, the number of snakes he has is x + 6.\n\nWe also know that the number of pets with four legs is six. Since dogs have four legs, we can say that the number of dogs Frankie has is six - 2 = 4.\n\nFinally, we know that Frankie has one less parrot than cats. Since parrots have two legs, we can say that the number of parrots Frankie has is x - 1.\n\nPutting it all together, we have:\n\nx + 6 (snakes) + 4 (dogs) + x - 1 (parrots) = 2 (dogs) + 4 (cats) + 6 (pets with four legs)\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n2x + 6 + 4 = 12\n\nSolving for x:\n\n2x = 12 - 6 - 4\n2x = 2\nx = 1\n\nSo, Frankie has one cat and one dog.\n\nTherefore, Frankie has 2 dogs."}

[/INST]  Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. Jeff was driving at 80 miles/hour for 6 hours. This means he covered a distance of 6 x 80 = 480 miles.\n2. Then the speed limit changed, and he had to slow down to 60 miles/hour. He drove at this speed for 4 hours, covering a distance of 4 x 60 = 240 miles.\n3. After the 4 hours, he made a stop at a gas station. Let's assume the stop took 30 minutes, during which time he didn't drive at all.\n4.

[/INST]  Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. Tom weighs 150 kg.\n2. He holds 1.5 times his weight in each hand. This means he holds a total weight of 150 kg x 1.5 = 225 kg.\n3. He wears a weight vest weighing half his weight, which means the weight vest weighs 150 kg / 2 = 75 kg.\n\nSo, the total weight Tom is holding, including the weight vest, is 225 kg + 75 kg = 300 kg.\n\nGiven that Tom can hold 300 kg in total, we can set up the following equation:\n\n300 kg = 150 kg (Tom's weight) + x (weight Tom is holding in each hand)\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = 300 kg - 150 kg = 150 kg\n\nTherefore, Tom can hold 150 kg in each hand while wearing a weight vest weighing half his weight."}

[/INST]  To find out how many friends Jenny signed up for dinner theater with, we need to use the information given in the question. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Each person pays $50 for the ticket, so the total amount paid by Jenny and her friends for tickets is 5 x $50 = $250.\n2. Each person also pays $10 for their entr\u00e9e, so the total amount paid by Jenny and her friends for entr\u00e9es is 5 x $10 = $50.\n3. Half of the people buy unlimited drink tickets for $30 per person, so the total amount paid by Jenny and her friends for drinks is 5 x $30 = $150.\n4. The dinner theater is canceled due to COVID, and each person gets a 90% refund. This means that Jenny and her friends will get a refund of 90% of the total amount they paid.\n5. We can calculate the total amount refunded to Jenny and her friends by multiplying the total amount they paid by 90%:\n\nRefund = $250 (tickets) + $50 (entr\u00e9es) + $150 (drinks) x 90%\nRefund = $250 + $50 + $150 x 90%\nRefund = $250 + $50 + $135 (since 90% of $150 is $135)\nRefund = $435\n\nNow, we can use the refund amount to find out how many friends Jenny signed up for dinner theater with. Since each person paid $50 for their ticket, we can divide the refund amount by $50 to find out how many tickets were purchased:\n\nNumber of friends = Refund amount \u00f7 $50\nNumber of friends = $435 \u00f7 $50\nNumber of friends = 8\n\nTherefore, Jenny signed up for dinner theater with 8 friends."}

Each attendee received 2 cans of soft drinks.\n\nNow, let's think about how we can use this information to find the number of males at the party:\n\n1. We know that there were 15 males at the party, so we can start by writing down the equation:\n\n15 = x\n\nWhere x is the number of males at the party.\n2. We know that there were 10 more girls at the party than males. This means that the number of girls at the party is 10 more than the number of males. We can write this as:\n\nNumber of girls = x + 10\n\nWhere x is the number of males at the party.\n3. We know that each attendee received 2 cans of soft drinks. This means that the total number of cans of soft drinks distributed is 2 times the total number of attendees. We can write this as:\n\nTotal number of cans = 2(x + number of girls)\n\nNow, we have three equations and three unknowns (x, number of girls, and total number of cans). We can solve this system of equations by substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution.\n\nFirst, solve the first equation for x:\n\nx = 15\n\nNow, substitute this value into the second equation:\n\nNumber of girls = 15 + 10\nNumber of girls = 25\n\nNow, substitute the value of x and the number of girls into the third equation:\n\nTotal number of cans = 2(15 + 25)\nTotal number of cans = 2(40)\nTotal number of cans = 80\n\nNow, we know that there were 80 cans of soft drinks distributed, and we know that each attendee received 2 cans, so there were 80/2 = 40 attendees at the party.\n\nWe also know that there were 15 males at the party, so the number of females at the party is "}

{"ground truth": 70.0, "prediction": "[INST] Luke takes a 70-minute bus to work every day. His coworker Paula takes 3/5 of this time to arrive by bus at work. How long does Luke take to get to work by bus every day? [/INST]  Let's assume that Luke's bus ride takes x minutes.\n\nWe know that Paula's bus ride takes 3/5 of the time that Luke takes, so Paula's bus ride takes 3/5x minutes.\n\nSince Paula takes the bus to work every day, her bus ride must be at least 70 minutes long (as that's how long it takes Luke to get to work by bus). So, we can set up the following inequality:\n\n3/5x \u2265 70\n\nTo solve for x, we can divide both sides by 3/5:\n\nx \u2265 140/3\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nx \u2265 46.67\n\nSince Luke's bus ride is 70 minutes long, we know that x = 70.\n\nSo, Luke takes 70 minutes to get to work by bus every day."}

Monday: 6 lessons of 30 minutes each = 6 x 30 = 180 minutes\n2. Tuesday: 3 lessons of 1 hour each = 3 x 60 = 180 minutes\n3. Wednesday: Adam spent twice as much time at school as on Tuesday, so he had 2 x 180 = 360 minutes of class on Wednesday.\n\nNow, we can let X be the number of lessons Adam had on Monday. Since Adam had 6 lessons of 30 minutes each on Monday, we can say that:\n\nX + 3 = 180 (since Adam had 3 lessons of 1 hour each on Tuesday)\nX + 2X = 360 (since Adam had twice as much time at school on Wednesday)\n\nSimplifying these two equations, we get:\n\n2X + 3 = 540\nX = 180 - 3\nX = 177\n\nTherefore, Adam had 177 lessons of 30 minutes each on Monday."}

{"ground truth": 15.0, "prediction": "[INST] Darrel is an experienced tracker. He can tell a lot about an animal by the footprints it leaves behind. One day he saw a set of coyote footprints. Based on the impressions, he could tell the animal was traveling east at 15 miles per hour, and that the animal left the prints 1 hour ago. How fast was the animal traveling? [/INST]  To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of relative motion. Let's assume the animal was traveling at a speed of x miles per hour.\n\nWe know that the animal traveled 15 miles per hour east, which means it covered 15 miles in 1 hour.\n\nNow, let's consider the animal's motion relative to Darrel's location. Since Darrel is standing still, the animal's motion relative to him is equal to its actual speed. In other words, the animal was traveling at a speed of x miles per hour relative to Darrel.\n\nWe also know that the animal left the footprints 1 hour ago, which means it took 1 hour for the animal to cover the distance between its current location and the location where it left the footprints. Since the distance between these two locations is 15 miles, we can set up the following equation:\n\nx = 15 / 1\n\nThis equation states that the animal's speed (x) is equal to the distance it traveled (15 miles) divided by the time it took to cover that distance (1 hour).\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = 15 / 1 = 15 miles per hour\n\nTherefore, the animal was traveling at a speed of 15 miles per hour relative to Darrel's location."}

[/INST]  Let's first find the lifespan of the bat, which we can call \"B\". The lifespan of the hamster, \"H\", is 6 years less than that of the bat, so we can write:\n\nH = B - 6\n\nThe lifespan of the frog, \"F\", is 4 times that of the hamster, so we can write:\n\nF = 4H\n\nWe know that the total lifespan of all three animals is 30 years, so we can write:\n\nB + H + F = 30\n\nNow we have a system of equations:\n\nH = B - 6\nF = 4H\nB + H + F = 30\n\nWe can solve this system of equations by substituting the expression for F into the equation for B + H + F:\n\nB + (B - 6) + 4(B - 6) = 30\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\n2B - 6 + 4B - 24 = 30\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n6B - 30 = 30\n\nAdd 30 to both sides:\n\n6B = 60\n\nDivide by 6:\n\nB = 10\n\nSo the lifespan of the bat is 10 years. We can now find the lifespan of the hamster by substituting B into the equation H = B - 6:\n\nH = 10 - 6\nH = 4\n\nThe lifespan of the hamster is 4 years. The lifespan of the bat is 10 - 6 = 4 years more than the lifespan of the hamster."}

[/INST]  To determine the age of the trees, we need to first determine the number of rings per year. We know that each tree's rings come in groups of two fat rings and four thin rings, so we can assume that each group represents two years. Therefore, the number of rings per year is half the number of groups.\n\nFor the first tree, Billy counts 70 ring groups, so the number of rings per year is 70/2 = 35 rings per year.\n\nFor the second tree, Billy counts 40 ring groups, so the number of rings per year is 40/2 = 20 rings per year.\n\nNow, we can calculate the age of each tree by multiplying the number of rings per year by the number of years that Billy counted:\n\nFirst tree: 35 rings per year x 70 years = 2450 rings\nSecond tree: 20 rings per year x 40 years = 800 rings\n\nThe first tree is therefore 2450 - 800 = 1650 rings older than the second tree.\n\nWe can convert this difference to years by dividing by the number of rings per year for each tree:\n\n1650 rings / 35 rings per year = 47 years\n\nSo, the first tree is 47 years older than the second tree."}

So, we need 18 pancakes in total (1.875 rounded up to 2).\n\nNow, let's think about how we can use the information about the number of pancakes needed to find the number of friends Willow's daughter had at the slumber party.\n\nIf Willow's daughter had x friends at the slumber party, then the total number of pancakes needed would be x x 1.5 (since each friend wanted a serving and a half of pancakes).\n\nWe know that the total number of pancakes needed was 18, so we can set up the equation:\n\nx x 1.5 = 18\n\nNow, let's divide both sides of the equation by 1.5 to solve for x:\n\nx = 12\n\nSo, Willow's daughter had 12 friends at the slumber party."}

This means that for every red car, there are four green cars.\n\nSo, if there are x red cars, there are 4x green cars.\n\nWe also know that there are 6 more red cars than purple cars. This means that the number of red cars is 6 more than the number of purple cars.\n\nLet's call the number of purple cars \"p\". Then, the number of red cars is p + 6.\n\nWe can set up an equation using this information:\n\n4x = p + 6\n\nNow, we need to solve for \"p\", the number of purple cars. We can do this by subtracting 6 from both sides of the equation:\n\n4x = p + 6\n4x - 6 = p\n\nNow, we can divide both sides of the equation by 4 to solve for \"p\":\n\np = 4x - 6\n\nNow, we need to find the number of red cars, which we can do by adding 6 to the number of purple cars:\n\nNumber of red cars = p + 6\n\nSubstituting the expression we derived for \"p\" in terms of \"x\", we get:\n\nNumber of red cars = 4x - 6 + 6\nNumber of red cars = 4x\n\nSo, there are 4x red cars and p purple cars.\n\nTo find the difference between the number of red cars and the number of purple cars, we can subtract \"p\" from the number of red cars:\n\nNumber of red cars - Number of purple cars = 4x - p\n\nSubstituting the expression we derived for \"p\" in terms of \"x\", we get:\n\nNumber of red cars - Number of purple cars = 4x - (4x - 6)\nNumber of red cars - Number of purple cars = 4x - 4x + 6\nNumber of red cars - Number of purple cars = 6\n\nSo, there are 6 more red cars than purple cars."}

For 4 hours, 28 athletes left the camp per hour, meaning 28 x 4 = 112 athletes left the camp.\n3. After the 4 hours, a new group of athletes arrived at a rate of 15 athletes per hour for 7 hours. This means that in total, 15 x 7 = 105 athletes arrived at the camp.\n4. The camp gate was shut, and everyone went to bed.\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of athletes who spent Saturday night at the camp:\n\n300 (initial athletes) - 112 (athletes who left) + 105 (athletes who arrived) = 193\n\nTherefore, 193 athletes spent Saturday night at Ultimate Fitness Camp."}
{"ground truth": 3.0, "prediction": "[INST] A mother is making her own bubble mix out of dish soap and water for her two-year-old son. The recipe she is following calls for 3 tablespoons of soap for every 1 cup of water. How many tablespoons of soap does the recipe call for? [/INST]  To determine how many tablespoons of soap the recipe calls for, we need to know how many cups of water are being used. The recipe states that 3 tablespoons of soap are needed for every 1 cup of water.\n\nLet's assume that the mother is making a batch of bubble mix that uses 1 cup of water. Therefore, the recipe would call for 3 tablespoons of soap.\n\nIf the mother were to double the recipe to make a larger batch of bubble mix, she would need 6 tablespoons of soap (3 tablespoons per cup of water x 2 cups of water).\n\nIn general, the amount of soap needed for the recipe would be calculated as follows:\n\nSoap needed (in tablespoons) = Number of cups of water x 3 tablespoons/cup\n\nSo, if the mother wants to make a batch of bubble mix using 3 cups of water, she would need 9 tablespoons of soap (3 cups x 3 tablespoons/cup = 9 tablespoons)."}

{"ground truth": 5.0, "prediction": "[INST] Betsy won 5 games of Monopoly. Helen won twice as many as Betsy and Susan won three times as many as Betsy. How many games of Monopoly did Betsy win? [/INST]  Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem:\n\n* Betsy won 5 games of Monopoly.\n* Helen won twice as many games as Betsy.\n* Susan won three times as many games as Betsy.\n\nWe can start by using the information about Betsy's wins to find the total number of games played. If Betsy won 5 games, then the total number of games played is 5 + 5 = 10 (since each game has a winner and a loser).\n\nNow, let's use the information about Helen's wins to find out how many games Helen won. Helen won twice as many games as Betsy, so Helen won 2 \u00d7 5 = 10 games.\n\nNext, let's use the information about Susan's wins to find out how many games Susan won. Susan won three times as many games as Betsy, so Susan won 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 games.\n\nNow that we have the total number of games played (10) and the number of games won by each player (Betsy: 5, Helen: 10, Susan: 15), we can find the number of games won by each player as a percentage of the total number of games played:\n\n* Betsy won 5/10 = 0.5 or 50% of the games.\n* Helen won 10/10 = 1 or 100% of the games.\n* Susan won 15/10 = 1.5 or 150% of the games.\n\nFinally, we can use the information about the number of games won by each player to find out how many games were played in total. Since Betsy won 5 games, and the total number of games played is 10, we know that 5/10 = 0.5 or 50% of the games were won by Betsy.\n\nTherefore, Betsy won 5 games out of 10, and the total number of games played was 10."}

How much does he make it in batches? [/INST]  To determine how often Jack makes his cold brew coffee, we need to first convert the amount of coffee he drinks per 2 days to gallons.\n\nThere are 128 ounces in a gallon, so 96 ounces is equivalent to 0.75 gallons.\n\nSince Jack drinks 0.75 gallons of coffee every 2 days, we can say that he consumes coffee at a rate of 0.75 gallons per 2 days.\n\nNow, we know that it takes 20 hours to make coffee. Assuming that Jack makes coffee continuously for 20 hours without any breaks, we can calculate the amount of coffee he makes in a single batch as follows:\n\nBatch size = Total amount of coffee consumed per 2 days / Time taken to make coffee\n\nBatch size = 0.75 gallons / 20 hours\n\nBatch size = 0.0375 gallons per hour\n\nSince Jack makes coffee in batches of 1.5 gallons, we can round up the batch size to the nearest whole number. In this case, we can round up 0.0375 to 0.1 gallons.\n\nTherefore, Jack makes his cold brew coffee in batches of 0.1 gallons (or 100.5 ounces) per hour.\n\nTo determine how many batches Jack makes in 2 days, we can divide the total amount of coffee consumed per 2 days by the batch size:\n\nNumber of batches = Total amount of coffee consumed per 2 days / Batch size\n\nNumber of batches = 0.75 gallons / 0.1 gallons\n\nNumber of batches = 7.5 batches\n\nTherefore, Jack makes 7.5 batches of cold brew coffee every 2 days."}

The number of cargo ships is twice the number of cruise ships, so if there are 4 cruise ships, there are 4 x 2 = 8 cargo ships.\n2. The number of sailboats is 6 more than the number of cargo ships, so the number of sailboats is 8 + 6 = 14.\n3. The number of sailboats is seven times the number of fishing boats, so the number of fishing boats is 14 / 7 = 2.\n4. Therefore, the busy port has 4 cruise ships, 8 cargo ships, 14 sailboats, and 2 fishing boats."}

The blacksmith promises to give them however many horseshoes he has left when he has finished his orders for the farms and stables. How much iron does the blacksmith have to make horseshoes for neighbouring farms and stables? [/INST]  To determine how much iron the blacksmith has to make horseshoes for the neighboring farms and stables, we first need to calculate the total number of horses that need horseshoes.\n\nThere are 2 farms with 2 horses each, so that's 4 horses.\nThere are 2 stables with 5 horses each, so that's 10 horses.\n\nTotal number of horses that need horseshoes = 4 + 10 = 14 horses.\n\nSince each horse needs four horseshoes (two in the front and two in the back), the blacksmith needs to make a total of 14 horses x 4 shoes per horse = 56 horseshoes.\n\nNow, we need to calculate how much iron the blacksmith needs to make 56 horseshoes. The weight of a horseshoe can vary depending on the size and thickness of the shoe, but on average, a horseshoe weighs around 1-2 kg. Let's assume that the blacksmith is using a heavy-duty horseshoe that weighs 2 kg each.\n\nTherefore, the blacksmith needs 56 horseshoes x 2 kg per horseshoe = 112 kg of iron to make horseshoes for the neighboring farms and stables.\n\nSo, the blacksmith has 400 kg - 112 kg = 288 kg of iron left to make horseshoes for the riding school."}

In the final game Duke made 5 free throws (worth one point), and 4 regular baskets (worth two points), and some three-pointers. Normally, he scores 2 three-pointers a game. How many more points does he need to tie the record? [/INST]  To determine how many points Duke needs to tie the record, we need to calculate the total number of points he needs to score in the final game to reach the record.\n\nThe old record is 257 points, so Duke needs to score 257 points to tie the record.\n\nDuke has already scored 17 points in the game, so he needs to score 257 - 17 = 239 points to tie the record.\n\nSince Duke typically scores 2 three-pointers per game, and each three-pointer is worth 3 points, he can score 6 points from three-pointers.\n\nTherefore, Duke needs to score 239 - 6 = 233 points from free throws and regular baskets to tie the record.\n\nSince each free throw is worth 1 point and each regular basket is worth 2 points, Duke needs to score 233 / 2 = 116 points from free throws and regular baskets to tie the record.\n\nHowever, we are told that Duke made 5 free throws and 4 regular baskets in the final game. Therefore, he scored a total of 5 + 4*2 = 14 points from free throws and regular baskets.\n\nSince 14 points is less than the 116 points Duke needs to score to tie the record, he does not have enough points to tie the record.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question \"How many more points does he need to tie the record?\" is 116 - 14 = 102 points. Duke needs to score 102 more points to tie the school record for most points scored in a basketball season."}

{"ground truth": 35.0, "prediction": "[INST] The journey from Abel's house to Alice's house is 35 miles and is divided into 5 equal portions. Abel is driving at a speed of 40 miles per hour. How long is the journey from Abel's house to Alice's house? [/INST]  To find the length of the journey from Abel's house to Alice's house, we need to first find the length of each of the 5 equal portions into which the journey is divided.\n\nLet's call the length of each portion \"x\".\n\nWe know that the total distance between Abel's house and Alice's house is 35 miles, so the sum of the lengths of all 5 portions must equal 35 miles:\n\nx + x + x + x + x = 35\n\nSince the journey is divided into 5 equal portions, each portion must have the same length. Therefore, we can write:\n\nx = 35/5\n\nx = 7\n\nSo, the length of each portion of the journey is 7 miles.\n\nNow, we know that Abel is driving at a speed of 40 miles per hour, so it will take him 7/40 hours to cover each portion of the journey:\n\ntime = distance / speed\n\ntime = 7 / 40\n\ntime = 0.175 hours\n\nSince there are 5 portions of the journey, the total time it will take Abel to travel from his house to Alice's house will be 5 times the time it takes him to cover one portion:\n\ntotal time = 5 x 0.175 hours\n\ntotal time = 0.875 hours\n\nTherefore, the journey from Abel's house to Alice's house will take 0.875 hours, or 53 minutes."}

[/INST]  Let's start by using the information that the school had twice as much cherry punch as orange punch. This means that if they had 4.5 liters of orange punch, they had 4.5 x 2 = 9 liters of cherry punch.\n\nWe also know that they had 1.5 liters less of apple juice than cherry punch. So, if they had 9 liters of cherry punch, they had 9 - 1.5 = 7.5 liters of apple juice.\n\nNow, we can set up a equation to represent the information we have:\n\n4.5 + 9 + 7.5 = Total amount of punch\n\nWe know that the total amount of punch is equal to 4.5 liters (orange punch) + 9 liters (cherry punch) + 7.5 liters (apple juice).\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n4.5 + 9 + 7.5 = 4.5 + 9 + 7.5\n\nSolving for the variable \"Total amount of punch\", we get:\n11 = Total amount of punch\n\nSo, the total amount of punch the school had was 11 liters.\n\nNow, to find out how many liters of orange punch they had, we can substitute the value we found for the total amount of punch into the equation:\n4.5 + 9 + 7.5 = 11\n\nSubtracting 9 (cherry punch) from both sides gives us:\n4.5 + 7.5 = 2\n\nSubtracting 7.5 (apple juice) from both sides gives us:\n4.5 = 2\n\nDividing both sides by 2 gives us:\n2.25 = 2\n\nTherefore, the school had 2.25 liters of orange punch."}

{"ground truth": 46.0, "prediction": "[INST] A farmer has 46 chickens. Each chicken gives him 6 eggs a week. How many chickens does the farmer have? [/INST]  This is a classic lateral thinking puzzle that challenges the listener's assumption and requires creative thinking. The answer is not a specific number, but rather a consideration of the puzzle's inherent contradictions.\n\nThe puzzle states that each chicken gives the farmer 6 eggs a week, which means the total number of eggs the farmer receives per week is 46 chickens x 6 eggs/chicken/week = 276 eggs/week.\n\nHowever, this raises a question: if the farmer has 46 chickens, and each chicken lays 6 eggs per week, then the total number of eggs the farmer should receive per week is 46 chickens x 6 eggs/chicken/week = 276 eggs/week.\n\nThe puzzle's paradox arises from the fact that the farmer cannot have 46 chickens and receive 276 eggs per week simultaneously. This is because, if the farmer has 46 chickens, each chicken would lay 6 eggs per week, resulting in a total of 46 x 6 = 276 eggs per week. Conversely, if the farmer receives 276 eggs per week, he would have 276 / 6 = 46 chickens, which contradicts the given information.\n\nTherefore, we have reached an impasse. The puzzle's internal logic has led us to a paradox, suggesting that our initial assumptions must be incorrect. We must re-examine the given information and question our initial understanding.\n\nThe answer to the puzzle is that the farmer does not have 46 chickens. Instead, he has fewer than 46 chickens, as the number of chickens is a variables that can be adjusted to resolve the paradox. The exact number of chickens the farmer has cannot be determined from the given information alone, as it depends on the specific number of eggs each chicken lays per week.\n\nThe solution requires recognizing the puzzle's self-contradiction and realizing that the initial information must be adjusted to eliminate the paradox. This kind of thinking is what distinguishes lateral thinking puzzles from more traditional, logic-based puzzles."}

Since all the rooms are the same size, except for the living room, we can multiply the number of rooms by the area of each room to get the total area of the apartment:\n\n6 rooms x 160 square feet per room = 960 square feet\n\nNow, we need to subtract the area of the living room from the total area to get the area of the other rooms. Since the living room is as big as 3 other rooms, we can assume that its area is 3 times the area of each room:\n\nLiving room area = 3 x 160 square feet = 480 square feet\n\nSubtracting the area of the living room from the total area gives us the area of the other rooms:\n\n960 square feet - 480 square feet = 480 square feet\n\nNow, we can divide the area of the other rooms by the number of rooms to find the width of each room:\n\n480 square feet \u00f7 6 rooms = 80 square feet per room\n\nFinally, we can add the width of each room to find the total width of the apartment:\n\n80 square feet x 6 rooms = 480 square feet\n\nSo, the width of Mark's apartment is 480 square feet, or 16 feet."}

To do this, we need to use a strategy that involves breaking down the problem into smaller parts and solving each part step by step. Here's how we can do it:\n\nStep 1: Find out how much gas Jim has left in his tank.\nWe know that Jim has 2/3 of a tank left, so we can calculate the amount of gas he has left by multiplying 2/3 by 12 gallons (the capacity of his tank):\n\n2/3 \u00d7 12 gallons = 8 gallons\n\nStep 2: Find out how far Jim can drive with the gas he has left.\nWe know that Jim drives 10 miles to and from work each day, so he drives a total of 20 miles per day. We can calculate how many days Jim can drive with the gas he has left by dividing the amount of gas he has left by the number of miles he drives per day:\n\n8 gallons / 20 miles per day = 0.4 days\n\nStep 3: Convert the number of days to miles.\nSince Jim drives 20 miles per day, we can calculate the number of miles he can drive with the gas he has left by multiplying the number of days he can drive by the number of miles he drives per day:\n\n0.4 days \u00d7 20 miles per day = 8 miles\n\nSo, Jim can drive 8 miles with the gas he has left.\n\nStep 4: Find out how many gallons of gas Jim uses to drive 8 miles.\nWe can calculate how many gallons of gas Jim uses to drive 8 miles by dividing the number of miles he drives by the number of miles each gallon of gas gets him:\n\n8 miles / ? = 8 gallons\n\nThe question mark represents the number of miles each gallon of gas gets Jim.

[/INST]  To calculate how much money John made doing Uber, we need to subtract the depreciation cost of his car from the amount he made.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the depreciation cost of the car. Let's assume that the car's value depreciated by $10,000 over the time John used it for Uber. This means that the car's value went from $18,000 to $8,000 ($18,000 - $10,000 = $8,000).\n\nNow, let's calculate John's profit from doing Uber:\n\nProfit = Total amount made - Depreciation cost\n\nProfit = $30,000 - $10,000\n\nProfit = $20,000\n\nSo, John made $20,000 doing Uber, factoring in the cost of depreciation for his car.\n\nHowever, when John traded in the car, he got $6,000 back, which means he actually made more money than he thought.

The next day, she finished the last 16 problems at lunch.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of problems Rachel solved:\n\n12 minutes x 5 problems/minute = 60 problems\n\nBut we know that she didn't finish all of them, so let's subtract the 16 problems she finished the next day:\n\n60 problems - 16 problems = 44 problems\n\nNow, we know that Rachel solved 44 math problems in 12 minutes before bed. To find out how many problems she solved each minute, we can divide the total number of problems by the number of minutes:\n\n44 problems \u00f7 12 minutes = 3.67 problems/minute\n\nSo, Rachel solved approximately 3.67 math problems each minute before bed."}
{"ground truth": 200.0, "prediction": "[INST] Greg is riding his bike around town and notices that each block he rides, his wheels rotate 200 times. He's now on a a trail and wants to make sure he rides at least 8 blocks. How many times do Greg's wheels rotate for each block he rides? [/INST]  To determine how many times Greg's wheels rotate for each block he rides, we need to divide the number of wheel rotations he notices by the number of blocks he rides.\n\nGreg notices that his wheels rotate 200 times for each block he rides, so we can set up a proportion to represent this relationship:\n\n200 wheel rotations / 1 block = x wheel rotations / 1 block\n\nwhere x is the number of wheel rotations for each block Greg rides on the trail.\n\nSince Greg wants to ride at least 8 blocks, we can set up an equation using the proportion:\n\n200 / 1 = x / 8\n\nWe can cross-multiply and simplify the equation:\n\n200 = 8x\n\nNow, we can divide both sides by 8 to solve for x:\n\nx = 200/8\nx = 25\n\nSo, Greg's wheels will rotate 25 times for each block he rides on the trail."}
{"ground truth": 25.0, "prediction": "[INST] Ethyl bought Lucy two new dolls for her doll collection. This increased the doll collection by 25%. By what percentage did the doll collection increase? [/INST]  To find the percentage increase of the doll collection, we need to first find the total number of dolls in the collection after Ethyl bought the two new dolls.\n\nLet's assume that Lucy had x dolls in her collection before Ethyl bought the new dolls. Now, after Ethyl bought the two new dolls, Lucy has x + 2 dolls in her collection.\n\nWe know that the total number of dolls in the collection increased by 25%, so we can write:\n\nx + 2 = 1.25x\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\nx + 2 = 1.25x\n\nSubtracting x from both sides, we get:\n\n2 = 0.25x\n\nDividing both sides by 0.25, we get:\n\n8 = x\n\nSo, Lucy had 8 dolls in her collection before Ethyl bought the new dolls, and now she has 8 + 2 = 10 dolls in her collection.\n\nTherefore, the doll collection increased by 25% (or 1/4)."}

[/INST]  Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem:\n\n1. Leah bought 3 boxes of birdseed.\n2. She already had 5 boxes of birdseed in the pantry.\n3. Her parrot eats 100 grams of seeds each week.\n4. Her cockatiel eats 50 grams of seeds in a week.\n\nNow, let's think about how we can use this information to find out how many boxes of birdseed Leah bought. Since Leah already had 5 boxes of birdseed in the pantry, the 3 boxes she bought are in addition to the 5 already there. So, the total number of boxes of birdseed Leah has is 5 + 3 = 8 boxes.\n\nWe can also use the information about the birds' seed consumption to find out how many grams of seeds are in each box. Let's assume that each box of birdseed contains 100 grams of seeds (this is a reasonable assumption since the parrot eats 100 grams of seeds per week). If each box contains 100 grams of seeds, then the total number of grams of seeds in 8 boxes is 8 x 100 = 800 grams.\n\nNow, we can divide the total number of grams of seeds by the number of grams of seeds the birds eat in a week to find out how many boxes of birdseed Leah bought:\n\n800 grams / (100 grams/week + 50 grams/week) = 800 grams / 150 grams/week = 5.33 boxes\n\nSince you can't have a fraction of a box, we can round up to the nearest whole number, which is 6 boxes. Therefore, Leah bought 6 boxes of birdseed."}

Then, the number of spaces in section 3 is \"x - 200\".\n\nWe know that the total number of spaces in the parking lot is 1000, so we can set up the equation:\n\n320 + x + (x - 200) = 1000\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n320 + 2x - 200 = 1000\n\nMoving all the terms to the left-hand side:\n\n520 = 1000\n\nOops, that doesn't work!

Let's try again, using the same approach but with different numbers.\n\nThis time, let's say that section 2 has 250 spaces, and section 3 has 250 - 200 = 50 spaces.\n\nSo, the total number of spaces in the parking lot is:\n\n320 + 250 + 50 = 620\n\nThat's still not enough spaces to accommodate 1000 cars. Let's try again with different numbers.\n\nHow about this: section 1 has 320 spaces, section 2 has 300 spaces, and section 3 has 400 spaces?\n\nThe total number of spaces in the parking lot is:\n\n320 + 300 + 400 = 1020\n\nOops, that's still not enough!

Today, he gave rides to three groups, drove for eight hours, and had to put 17 gallons of gas at $3 per gallon in the limo to refill the tank. He got two good reviews. What is his hourly wage? [/INST]  First, let's calculate Hayden's total earnings for the day:\n\n1. Hourly wage: 8 hours x $15/hour = $120\n2. Additional payment per ride: 3 rides x $5/ride = $15\n3. Bonus for positive reviews: 2 good reviews x $20/review = $40\n\nTotal earnings = $120 + $15 + $40 = $175\n\nNow, let's calculate Hayden's hourly wage including the gas reimbursement:\n\n1. Total earnings: $175\n2. Gas expenses: 17 gallons x $3/gallon = $51\n3. Gas reimbursement: $51 (since Hayden gets reimbursed for the gas he puts in the limo)\n\nHourly wage including gas reimbursement = Total earnings - Gas reimbursement\n= $175 - $51\n= $124\n\nSo, Hayden's hourly wage including the gas reimbursement is $124."}

This means that if her mother is x years old, then Darcie is x/6 years old.\n\nWe also know that her mother is 4/5 as old as her father. This means that if her father is y years old, then her mother is 4/5y years old.\n\nWe can set up an equation using this information:\n\nDarcie's age = (4/5) Mother's age = (4/5) (4/5y) = 4/5y/6\n\nWe know that Darcie is 4 years old, so we can substitute 4 for y:\n\n4/5y/6 = 4\n\nNow, we can simplify the equation:\n\n4/5(4/5) = 4\n\n(4/5)^2 = 4\n\n16/25 = 4\n\nNow, we have a problem.

So, if Dave weighs x pounds, he can bench press 3x pounds.\n\nWe know that Craig can bench press 20% of the amount Dave can. So, if Dave can bench press 3x pounds, Craig can bench press 0.2(3x) = 0.6x pounds.\n\nWe also know that Mark is new and can bench press 50 pounds less than Craig. So, if Craig can bench press 0.6x pounds, Mark can bench press 0.6x - 50 pounds.\n\nNow, we can set up a equation using this information:\n\nDave's weight = x pounds\nCraig's weight = x / 0.2 pounds (since Craig can bench press 20% of Dave's weight)\nMark's weight = x / 0.2 - 50 pounds (since Mark can bench press 50 pounds less than Craig)\n\nWe can simplify this equation by substituting Craig's weight in terms of Dave's weight:\n\nCraig's weight = x / 0.2\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for Craig's weight in the equation for Mark's weight:\n\nMark's weight = (x / 0.2) - 50\n\nNow, we can simplify this equation by substituting Dave's weight in terms of x:\n\nMark's weight = x / 0.2 - 50\n\nNow, we can solve for x (Dave's weight) by adding 50 to both sides of the equation:\n\nx / 0.2 = Mark's weight + 50\n\nx = 0.2(Mark's weight + 50)\n\nNow, we can plug in the value of Mark's weight (50 pounds less than Craig's weight) into the equation:\n\nx = 0.2(0.6x - 50 + 50)\n\nx = 0.2(0.6x - 50) + 100\n\nx = 0.2(0.6x) - 50 +"}

[/INST]  Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem:\n\n* The old bridge had 5 lanes and 2000 vehicles passing through it every month.\n* The new bridge has twice the capacity of the old one, meaning it can handle twice the number of vehicles that the old bridge could handle.\n* The number of vehicles passing through the new bridge increased by 60% more than the old bridge.\n\nSince the new bridge has twice the capacity of the old bridge, it can handle 2 x 2000 = 4000 vehicles per month.\n\nThe increase in the number of vehicles passing through the new bridge is 60% more than the old bridge. This means that the number of vehicles passing through the new bridge is 1.6 times the number of vehicles passing through the old bridge.\n\nSo, the number of vehicles passing through the new bridge is 1.6 x 2000 = 3200 vehicles per month.\n\nSince the new bridge has twice the capacity of the old bridge, it must have twice the number of lanes as the old bridge.

Customer C buys 7 units.\n6. All non-defective units are sold.\n\nNow, let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. First, the owner gets rid of the defective units, so the number of non-defective units is:\n20 - 5 = 15\n2. Customer A buys 3 units, so the number of non-defective units left is:\n15 - 3 = 12\n3. Customer B buys a certain amount of units, let's say x units. So, the number of non-defective units left is:\n12 - x\n4. Customer C buys 7 units, so the number of non-defective units left is:\n12 - x - 7 = 5\n5. Since all non-defective units are sold, the number of non-defective units left must be 0. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n5 = 12 - x - 7\n6. Solving for x, we get:\nx = 5 + 7 = 12\n\nSo, Customer B buys 12 units.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of units sold:\n\nCustomer A buys 3 units.\nCustomer B buys 12 units.\nCustomer C buys 7 units.\nTotal number of units sold = 3 + 12 + 7 = 22 units.\n\nTherefore, the store contains 22 units of phones after all non-defective units are sold."}

What is the cost of the car he wants? [/INST]  To calculate the cost of the car, you'll need to consider both the purchase price and the interest paid over the life of the loan.\n\n1. Purchase Price:\nThe car costs $32,000.\n2. Down Payment:\nJason can make a down payment of $8,000.\n3. Loan Amount:\nThe loan amount is the difference between the purchase price and the down payment:\nLoan Amount = Purchase Price - Down Payment\nLoan Amount = $32,000 - $8,000\nLoan Amount = $24,000\n4. Monthly Payments:\nJason will make 48 equal monthly payments on the loan. To calculate the monthly payment, you can use the formula:\nMonthly Payment = Loan Amount / Number of Payments\nMonthly Payment = $24,000 / 48\nMonthly Payment = $492\n5. Interest Paid:\nSince the interest rate is 5% of each month's payment, you can calculate the total interest paid over the life of the loan by multiplying the monthly payment by the number of payments and the interest rate:\nTotal Interest Paid = Monthly Payment x Number of Payments x Interest Rate\nTotal Interest Paid = $492 x 48 x 5%\nTotal Interest Paid = $11,576\n6. Total Cost:\nThe total cost of the car is the sum of the purchase price, down payment, and total interest paid:\nTotal Cost = Purchase Price + Down Payment + Total Interest Paid\nTotal Cost = $32,000 + $8,000 + $11,576\nTotal Cost = $41,576\n\nTherefore, the cost of the car Jason wants is $41,576, which takes into account both the purchase price and the interest paid over the life of the loan."}

That means the teacher will buy 1.73 + 0.07 = 1.8 pieces of cheese for every student in the class.\n\nTherefore, the answer to your question is: the teacher will buy 1.8 pieces of cheese for every student in the class."}
{"ground truth": 20.0, "prediction": "[INST] In seven years, Talia will be 20 years old. Talia's mom is currently three times as old as Talia is today. In three years, Talia's father will be the same age as Talia's mom is today. How old will Talia be in seven years? [/INST]  Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. Talia's mom is currently three times as old as Talia is today. So, if Talia is currently x years old, her mom is 3x years old.\n2. In three years, Talia's father will be the same age as Talia's mom is today. So, in three years, Talia's father will be 3x years old.\n3. In seven years, Talia will be 20 years old. So, we can set up an equation based on this information:\n\nTalia's age in 7 years = 20\n\n4. We know that Talia's father will be 3x years old in three years, and Talia will be 20 years old in seven years. So, we can set up another equation:\n\nTalia's father's age in 3 years = 3x\nTalia's age in 7 years = 20\n\n5. Now we can solve for x. We know that Talia's father's age in three years will be equal to Talia's mom's age today, so we can set up an equation:\n\n3x = 3(Talia's mom's age today)\n\n6. We also know that Talia's age in seven years will be equal to 20, so we can set up an equation:\n\nx + 7 = 20\n\n7. Now we can solve for x. We know that x + 7 = 20, so we can subtract 7 from both sides:\n\nx = 13\n\n8. Now we know that Talia's mom's age today is 3x = 3(13) = 39 years old.\n\n9. We also know that Talia's father's age in three years will be 3x = 3(13) = 39 years old.\n\n10. Finally, we know that Talia's age in seven years will be 20 years old.\n\nSo, Talia will be 20 years old in seven years. Her mom is currently 39 years old, and her father will be 39 years old in three years."}

Horizontal pictures: Louise hangs the other half of her pictures horizontally, which means she hangs 30/2 = 15 pictures horizontally.\n3. Haphazardly placed pictures: Louise hangs the remaining 5 pictures haphazardly. Since there are 5 pictures left, and she hangs them haphazardly, we can assume that each picture is placed in a different position (i.e., none of the 5 pictures are placed in the same position).\n\nSo, in total, Louise hangs 15 + 15 + 5 = 35 pictures on the wall."}

Milly is considering switching to a new babysitter who charges $12/hour, but also charges an extra $3 for each time the kids scream at her. How much does Milly's babysitter charge per hour? [/INST]  To find out how much the new babysitter charges per hour, you need to add the hourly rate to the cost of any additional fees. In this case, the new babysitter charges $12/hour plus an extra $3 for each time the kids scream at her.\n\nLet's assume that the kids scream at the babysitter 3 times in a 2-hour period. The total cost for the 2 hours would be:\n\n$12/hour x 2 hours = $24\n+ $3/scream x 3 screams = $9\nTotal cost = $24 + $9 = $33\n\nTherefore, the new babysitter charges $33 for 2 hours of babysitting, which is equivalent to $16.50 per hour ($33 \u00f7 2 hours).\n\nSo, Milly's current babysitter charges $16/hour, and the new babysitter charges $16.50/hour.

We can use a variable, say 't', to represent the time it takes Kyle to travel to work and back.\n\nSo, ten times 't' is equal to the cost of a pack of snacks. We can write an equation to represent this:\n\n10t = cost of snacks\n\nNow, we know that Kyle bikes for 2 hours to work every day. Let's convert this to minutes:\n\n2 hours = 120 minutes (since there are 60 minutes in an hour)\n\nNow, let's use this information to find 't':\n\nt = 120 minutes / 2 (since Kyle bikes for 2 hours to work every day)\nt = 60 minutes\n\nNow, we have found 't'! Substituting this value into our initial equation:\n\n10(60) = cost of snacks\n600 = cost of snacks\n\nSo, the cost of a pack of snacks is $600.\n\nTo find out how many hours Kyle bikes to work every day, we can divide the time he spends biking each day by the time he spends biking to work and back:\n\n2 hours = (600 minutes) / (120 minutes per hour)\nKyle bikes for 5 hours to work every day.\n\nTherefore, Kyle bikes for 5 hours to work every day."}

Since he bought so many gems he got a 20% bonus of more gems. How much money does Tom spend to buy gems in the game he plays? [/INST]  To find out how much money Tom spends to buy gems in the game, we need to first find out how many gems he bought. We know that the game gives 100 gems for each dollar spent, so if Tom spent $250, he bought 25,000 gems (250 x 100 = 25,000).\n\nSince Tom got a 20% bonus of more gems, he actually got 20% more gems than 25,000. To find 20% of 25,000, we can multiply 25,000 by 0.20, which gives us 5,000. So, Tom got a total of 30,000 gems (25,000 + 5,000 = 30,000).\n\nNow, we can divide the total number of gems by the number of gems per dollar to find out how much money Tom spent:\n\n30,000 gems / 100 gems per dollar = $300\n\nSo, Tom spent $300 to buy gems in the game he plays."}

[/INST]  Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem:\n\n1. Each student received 62 red pens and 43 black pens.\n2.

After the second month, they had taken another 41 pens from the pool.\n5. Jane decided to split the remaining pens equally among them.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nThe total number of red pens the students had at first was 3 x 62 = 186 red pens.\nThe total number of black pens they had at first was 3 x 43 = 129 black pens.\n\nAfter the first month, they had taken a total of 37 pens from the pool. Let's assume that the number of red pens taken was x. Then, the number of black pens taken would be 37 - x.\n\nAfter the second month, they had taken another 41 pens from the pool. Let's assume that the number of red pens taken was y. Then, the number of black pens taken would be 41 - y.\n\nSince the students pool their pens together, the total number of red pens they have after the second month is the sum of the red pens they had after the first month and the red pens they took from the pool during the second month:\n\n186 + x + y = 129 + 37 - x + 41 - y\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n186 + x + y = 129 + 41\n\nSubtracting 129 from both sides gives us:\n\n57 = x + y\n\nNow, we need to find the value of x and y.

{"ground truth": 38.0, "prediction": "[INST] Hasan is packing up his apartment because he\u2019s moving across the country for a new job. He needs to ship several boxes to his new home. The movers have asked that Hasan avoid putting more than a certain weight in pounds in any cardboard box. The moving company has helpfully provided Hasan with a digital scale that will alert him if a package is too heavy. Hasan is in the kitchen, and he fills a cardboard box with 38 dinner plates. When he checks the box, the scale reports his box is too heavy. Hasan knows each of his plates weighs 10 ounces. He removes a single plate from the box and checks the movers\u2019 scale again. The scale reports his box is still too heavy. Hasan repeats the process again and again. When he has removed enough plates, the movers\u2019 scale shows the box is now an acceptable weight for shipping. Hasan deduces that each shipping box can hold 20 pounds before the scale says the box is too heavy. How many dinner plates does Hasan fill the cardboard box with? [/INST]  To solve this problem, we can use a process of elimination. We know that each plate weighs 10 ounces, so we can start by calculating the total weight of the plates in the box:\n\n38 plates x 10 ounces/plate = 380 ounces\n\nSince the scale reports that the box is too heavy, we know that the weight of the plates exceeds the maximum weight limit for the box. Let's assume that the maximum weight limit for the box is x pounds. We can convert this to ounces by multiplying by 16 (since there are 16 ounces in a pound):\n\nx pounds x 16 ounces/pound = x x 16 ounces\n\nWe know that the weight of the plates is 380 ounces, so we can set up the following equation:\n\n380 ounces <= x x 16 ounces\n\nNow, we can solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by 16:\n\n380 ounces <= x x 16 ounces\n23.75 pounds <= x\n\nWe know that the movers' scale reports that the box is too heavy when the weight exceeds 20 pounds, so we can deduce that the maximum weight limit for the box is 20 pounds. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\n20 pounds = x pounds\n\nNow, we can substitute this equation into the previous equation we set up:\n\n380 ounces <= 20 pounds x 16 ounces/pound\n380 ounces <= 320 ounces\n\nSince 380 ounces is greater than 320 ounces, we know that the maximum weight limit for the box is indeed 20 pounds.\n\nWe can now use this information to determine how many dinner plates Hasan can fill the cardboard box with. We know that each plate weighs 10 ounces, so we can calculate the number of plates that fit in the box by dividing the maximum weight limit by the weight of a single plate:\n\n20 pounds / 10 ounces/plate = 200 oun"}

[/INST]  Let's first calculate the total amount of money the family has:\n\n123 pennies = 123 cents\n85 nickels = 85 \\* 5 cents = 425 cents\n35 dimes = 35 \\* 10 cents = 350 cents\nquarter(s) = ?\n\nTotal amount of money = 123 + 425 + 350 + ? = 898 cents\n\nNow, let's calculate the cost of the ice cream:\n\n5 double scoops = 5 \\* 3 = 15 dollars\n15 dollars = 1500 cents\n\nNow, we can see that the family has enough money to buy the ice cream and still have some change left over:\n\n1500 cents - 898 cents = 602 cents\n\nSo, there are 602 cents left over after the trip to the ice cream shop.\n\nNow, we can calculate the number of pennies left over:\n\n602 cents = 602 / 0.01 = 6020 pennies\n\nTherefore, there are 6020 pennies in the jar after the trip to the ice cream shop."}

What fraction of the prize money did she get? [/INST]  Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. Rica's group won a dance competition.\n2. She got 3/8 of the prize money.\n3. She spent 1/5 of her prize money.\n4. She is now left with $300.\n\nWe can start by finding out how much prize money Rica got in total. If she got 3/8 of the prize money, we can multiply 3/8 by the total amount of prize money to find out how much she got:\n\n3/8 \u00d7 Total Prize Money = Rica's Prize Money\n\nWe don't know the total prize money, so let's call it x. Then we can write:\n\n3/8 \u00d7 x = Rica's Prize Money\n\nNow we know that Rica spent 1/5 of her prize money. We can find out how much she spent by multiplying her prize money by 1/5:\n\n1/5 \u00d7 Rica's Prize Money = Amount Rica Spent\n\nWe can substitute the expression we found for Rica's Prize Money:\n\n1/5 \u00d7 (3/8 \u00d7 x) = Amount Rica Spent\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n1/5 \u00d7 3/8 \u00d7 x = Amount Rica Spent\n\nNow we know that Rica is left with $300. We can set up an equation to represent this information:\n\nAmount Rica Spent + $300 = Rica's Prize Money\n\nSubstituting the expression we found for Amount Rica Spent, we get:\n\n1/5 \u00d7 3/8 \u00d7 x + $300 = 3/8 \u00d7 x\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nx/5 + $300 = x/8\n\nNow we can solve for x. We know that x/5 + $300 is equal to x/8. We can multiply both sides by 5 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n5x + $1500 = 5x/8\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$1500 = x/8\n\nNow we can solve for x. Multiplying both sides by 8, we get:\n\nx = 12000\n\nNow"}

Trish has two times as many stuffed animals as Barbara, which means Trish has 2 x 9 = 18 stuffed animals.\n3. Barbara will sell her stuffed animals for $2 each.\n4. Trish will sell her stuffed animals for $1.50 each.\n\nNow, we can calculate the total amount of money that Barbara and Trish will raise by selling their stuffed animals:\n\nBarbara: 9 stuffed animals x $2 each = $18\nTrish: 18 stuffed animals x $1.50 each = $27\n\nTotal: $18 + $27 = $45\n\nSince Trish has two times as many stuffed animals as Barbara, we can say that Barbara has half of the total number of stuffed animals. Therefore, Barbara has 9 / 2 = 4.5 stuffed animals.\n\nHowever, we know that Barbara has 9 stuffed animals, not 4.5. This means that Trish must have 2 x 9 = 18 stuffed animals, and Barbara has 9 stuffed animals.\n\nSo, to answer the question, Barbara has 9 stuffed animals."}

{"ground truth": 30.0, "prediction": "[INST] Lyla, a grocery store owner, bought rice weighing 30 kg less than green beans, which weigh 10 kg more than sugar. While carrying the goods to the store, the bags fell down and 1/3 weight of the rice and 1/5 weight of sugar was lost. How much less does the rice weigh compared to the green beans? [/INST]  Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. Green beans weigh 10 kg more than sugar. So, sugar weighs 10 kg - 10 kg = 0 kg.\n2. Rice weighs 30 kg less than green beans. So, rice weighs 10 kg + 30 kg = 40 kg.\n3. When the bags fell down, 1/3 of the rice and 1/5 of the sugar was lost. Let's find the weight of rice and sugar after the loss:\n\nRice: 40 kg - (1/3) = 40 kg - 13.33 kg = 26.67 kg\nSugar: 10 kg - (1/5) = 10 kg - 2 kg = 8 kg\n4. Now, we need to find out how much less the rice weighs compared to the green beans. We can do this by subtracting the weight of rice from the weight of green beans:\n\nGreen beans: 10 kg\nRice: 26.67 kg\n\nThe difference between the weights is:\n10 kg - 26.67 kg = -16.67 kg\n\nSo, the rice weighs 16.67 kg less than the green beans."}

Therefore, the party hall has only one decorative light bulb, which is the one that is on for 1 second.\n\nThe puzzle is trying to trick the listener into assuming that the light bulbs are decorative, when in fact, they are actually timing indicators. It's a clever play on words and a great example of a lateral thinking puzzle."}

{"ground truth": 40.0, "prediction": "[INST] Evan owns 40 fewer books than the number he had 2 years ago. Evan will have 60 more than five times as many books as he owns now in five years. How many fewer books does Evan own compared to 2 years ago? [/INST]  Let's assume that the number of books Evan had 2 years ago was x.\n\nWe know that Evan owns 40 fewer books than he had 2 years ago, so the number of books he has now is x - 40.\n\nWe also know that in 5 years, Evan will have 60 more than five times as many books as he owns now. So, the number of books Evan will have in 5 years is:\n\n(x - 40) + 60 + 5(x - 40) = 6x - 40 + 60 = 5x + 20\n\nNow, we can set up an equation using the information that Evan owns 40 fewer books than he had 2 years ago and that he will have 60 more than five times as many books as he owns now in 5 years:\n\nx - 40 = 5(x - 40) + 20\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\nx - 40 = 5x - 200\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = 240\n\nSo, Evan had 240 books 2 years ago, and he has (240 - 40) = 200 books now.

Then, the total cost of the spoons is x x $1.50 = $1.50x.\n3. The total cost of everything Chenny bought is the sum of the cost of the plates and the cost of the spoons: $18 + $1.50x.\n\nNow, we're given that the total cost of everything Chenny bought is $27. So, we can set up the equation:\n\n$18 + $1.50x = $27\n\nTo solve for x, we can subtract $18 from both sides:\n\n$1.50x = $9\n\nNext, we can divide both sides by $1.50:\n\nx = 6\n\nSo, Chenny bought 6 spoons.\n\nNow, we can go back to the first sentence of the problem: Chenny bought 9 plates at $2 each.

Let's call the capacity of the old tank \"x\" gallons. Then, the capacity of the new tank is 2x gallons.\n\nThe cost of refilling the new tank is $240, which means that the cost per gallon is:\n\nCost per gallon = $240 / 2x\nCost per gallon = $120 / x\n\nSince the cost per gallon is the same as the original cost per gallon, we can set up the equation:\n\n$120 / x = $200 / x\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = 120 / 200\nx = 0.6\n\nSo, the capacity of the old tank was 0.6 gallons.\n\nNow, we can find the cost of refilling the old tank by multiplying the capacity by the cost per gallon:\n\nCost of refilling the old tank = 0.6 x $200\nCost of refilling the old tank = $120\n\nTherefore, it used to cost $120 to refill the tank before the 20% increase in fuel prices."}

At the end of the game, each player takes one more bottle of water.\n\nWe can start by calculating the total number of water bottles taken by the players during the game:\n\n11 players x 2 bottles per player in the first break = 22 bottles\n11 players x 1 bottle per player at the end of the game = 11 bottles\nTotal number of bottles taken by players = 22 + 11 = 33 bottles\n\nNow, we need to calculate the number of players on the field in the match. We know that each player takes two bottles of water in the first break, so the total number of bottles taken by the players in the first break is 22 bottles.\n\nSince there are four dozen water bottles in the box, and each dozen contains 12 bottles, we can calculate the total number of bottles as follows:\n\n4 dozen = 4 x 12 = 48 bottles\n\nNow, we can calculate the number of players on the field as follows:\n\nNumber of players on the field = Total number of bottles taken by players / Number of bottles taken by each player in the first break\n= 33 bottles / 2 bottles per player\n= 16.5 players\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a player, we round up to the nearest whole number, which gives us 17 players on the field in the match.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is 17 players."}

Donna cuts each sandwich in half twice, so each sandwich is cut into 4 portions.\n\nNow, let's work backwards to find out how many sandwiches Donna makes:\n\n1. Donna gives 8 portions to each guest, so she needs to make 8 sandwiches for every guest.\n2. Since each sandwich is cut into 4 portions, Donna needs to make 8 x 4 = 32 sandwiches in total.\n3. Since each sandwich is cut in half twice, Donna actually makes 32 x 2 = 64 half-sandwiches.\n4. Since each half-sandwich is equivalent to a quarter of a sandwich, Donna makes 64 quarter-sandwiches.\n5. Therefore, Donna makes 64 / 4 = 16 whole sandwiches.\n\nSo, to summarize: Donna makes 16 whole sandwiches, which she then cuts into 32 half-sandwiches, and finally into 64 quarter-sandwiches to serve to her guests."}

How many fewer nickels does he have than quarters? [/INST]  Let's start by using the information that John has three more dimes than quarters. This means that for every quarter he has, he has three more dimes. So, if he has x quarters, he has 3x dimes.\n\nWe also know that he has 6 fewer nickels than quarters. This means that for every quarter he has, he has 6 fewer nickels. So, if he has x quarters, he has x - 6 nickels.\n\nNow, we can set up a system of equations to represent the information we have:\n\n1. Quarters: x\n2. Dimes: 3x\n3. Nickels: x - 6\n\nWe know that the total number of coins is equal to the sum of the number of quarters, dimes, and nickels. So, we can write:\n\nx + 3x + (x - 6) = total number of coins\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n4x - 6 = total number of coins\n\nNow, we can solve for x by adding 6 to both sides:\n\n4x = total number of coins + 6\n\nx = (total number of coins + 6) / 4\n\nSo, the number of quarters John has is (total number of coins + 6) / 4.\n\nNow, we can find the number of nickels by subtracting 6 from the number of quarters:\n\nNumber of nickels = (total number of coins + 6) / 4 - 6\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nNumber of nickels = (total number of coins + 6) / 4 - 6\n= (total number of coins + 6) / 4 - 6\n= total number of coins / 4 - 6\n\nTherefore, John has (total number of coins / 4 - 6) nickels."}

This means that Rupert's age is 3 times Peter's age plus 1/2 of Peter's age.\n\nLet's call Peter's age \"x\". Then Rupert's age is 3x + 1/2x = 3x + 1/2x = 4x + 1/2.\n\nWe know that Peter has 10 candles on his cake, so we can set up the equation:\n\n4x + 1/2 = 10\n\nTo solve for x, we can first simplify the equation by combining the fractions:\n\n4x + 1/2 = 4x + 0.5 = 4.5x = 10\n\nNow, we can divide both sides by 4.5 to find x:\n\nx = 10/4.5 = 2.22\n\nSo, Peter's age is 2.22 years.\n\nNow, we can find Rupert's age by multiplying Peter's age by 3 and adding 1/2:\n\nRupert's age = 3x + 1/2 = 3(2.22) + 1/2 = 6.66 + 1/2 = 7.66\n\nRupert has 7.66 years.\n\nTo find out how many candles Rupert has on his cake, we can use the same method:\n\nRupert has 7.66 years, so he has 76.6 months.\n\nSince there are 12 months in a year, Rupert has 76.6/12 = 6.38 years.\n\nFinally, we can find the number of candles on Rupert's cake by multiplying his age by 10:\n\nRupert has 6.38 years, so he has 63.8 months.\n\nSince there are 12 months in a year, Rupert has 63.8/12 = 5.31 years.\n\nTherefore, Rupert has "}

Since the number of students who bring their lunch is thrice this number, the number of students who bring their lunch is 3x.\n\nWe know that the total number of students in the class is 60, so we can set up the following equation:\n\nx + 3x + (60 - x - 3x) = 60\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n4x + 60 - 4x = 60\n\n2x = 60 - 60\n\n2x = 0\n\nSince x is a integer, x = 0 is not possible.

[/INST]  Let's start by using the information that Austin's trap caught 8 less than Victor's. So, if Victor's trap caught 26 shrimp, Austin's trap caught 26 - 8 = 18 shrimp.\n\nNext, we know that Brian's trap caught half of Victor and Austin's total number of shrimp. So, Brian's trap caught half of (26 + 18) = half of 44 = 22 shrimp.\n\nNow, we can use the fact that Victor's trap caught 26 shrimp and Brian's trap caught 22 shrimp to find out how many shrimp Victor's trap caught.\n\nVictor's trap caught 26 shrimp, and Brian's trap caught 22 shrimp, so the total number of shrimp caught by Victor and Brian is 26 + 22 = 48 shrimp.\n\nSince Austin's trap caught 18 shrimp, the total number of shrimp caught by all three traps is 48 + 18 = 66 shrimp.\n\nTherefore, Victor's trap caught 26 out of 66 shrimp, or approximately 40% of the total catch."}

When we add the cost of the coffee and the cheesecake together, we get:\n\n$6 + $7.50 = $13.50\n\nSo, the total cost of the coffee and cheesecake together is $13.50. But we were told that the client gets a 25% discount when buying them together. So, the total cost after the discount should be:\n\n$13.50 - (25% of $13.50) = $13.50 - $3.37 = $10.13\n\nNow, we can calculate the cost of the coffee by subtracting the cost of the cheesecake from the total cost:\n\n$10.13 - $7.50 = $2.63\n\nSo, the cost of the coffee is $2.63, and the cost of the cheesecake is $7"}

First, let's calculate the distance Diana can cover in 2 hours at 3 mph:\n\nDistance = Speed x Time\nDistance = 3 mph x 2 hours\nDistance = 6 miles\n\n2. Now, let's calculate the distance Diana can cover from the point where she gets tired until she reaches home, assuming she can maintain a speed of 1 mph:\n\nDistance = Speed x Time\nDistance = 1 mph x (total time - 2 hours)\nDistance = 1 mph x (30 minutes - 2 hours)\nDistance = 1 mph x 30 minutes\nDistance = 1/2 mile\n\n3. Since Diana needs to bike for a total of 10 miles to get home, we can set up an equation:\n\nTotal distance = Distance at 3 mph + Distance at 1 mph\nTotal distance = 6 miles + (1/2 mile)\nTotal distance = 6.5 miles\n\nTherefore, Diana needs to bike 6.5 miles to get home."}

After another 20 minutes, Georgia has completed twice as many problems, so she has completed 20/20 = 1 problem per minute.\n3. Georgia has 40 minutes to complete the rest of the test, so she can complete 40/1 = 40 problems in that time.\n4. Since Georgia has already completed 10 problems, there are 75 - 10 = 65 problems left for her to complete.\n5. Since Georgia can complete 40 problems in 40 minutes, she can complete 40/65 = 0.615 problems per minute.\n6. Since there are 75 problems on the test, Georgia has 75/0.615 = 122.5 minutes to complete the test.\n7. Since there are 75 problems on the test, Georgia has 75/122.5 = 0.615 problems per minute.\n8.

Her grandmother is twice the age of Grace's mother.\n\nSo, Grace's mother's age is half the age of her grandmother.\n\nNow, we can create a fraction to represent Grace's age compared to her grandmother's age:\n\nGrace's age = 3/8 grandmother's age\n\nSince Grace's mother's age is half the age of her grandmother, we can say that:\n\nGrace's mother's age = 1/2 grandmother's age\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for Grace's mother's age in the first equation:\n\nGrace's age = 3/8 (2 Grace's mother's age)\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\nGrace's age = 3/8 \u00d7 2 Grace's mother's age\nGrace's age = 6/8 Grace's mother's age\n\nSo, Grace's age is 6/8th the age of her mother.\n\nNow, we can express Grace's age as a fraction of her grandmother's age:\n\nGrace's age = 6/8 \u00d7 1/2 grandmother's age\nGrace's age = 6/16 grandmother's age\n\nTherefore, Grace's age is 6/16th the age of her grandmother."}

To find out how many steps he can walk in 30 minutes, we can multiply the number of steps per minute by 30:\n\n66.67 steps/minute x 30 minutes = 2,000 steps\n\nTherefore, Roger can walk 2,000 steps in 30 minutes."}
{"ground truth": 2.0, "prediction": "[INST] A retailer sells any shirt for the same price and any pair of pants for the same price, but the price of shirts and pants are not the same. Say you bought 2 shirts and 3 pairs of pants for $120 in total, then you realized you didn't need the extra pants. How many shirts did you buy? [/INST]  Let's say the price of one shirt is x and the price of one pair of pants is y.\n\nWe know that the total cost of the items is $120, so we can set up the equation:\n\n2x + 3y = 120\n\nNow, we know that the price of shirts and pants are not the same, so we can assume that x \u2260 y.\n\nWe can also see that the number of shirts is twice the number of pairs of pants, so we can write:\n\n2x = 3y\n\nNow, we can substitute this equation into the first equation:\n\n2x + 3y = 120\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n3x = 120\n\nDividing by 3, we get:\n\nx = 40\n\nSo, the price of one shirt is $40.\n\nNow, we can find the number of shirts bought by dividing the total cost by the price of one shirt:\n\nNumber of shirts = Total cost / Price of one shirt\n= 120 / 40\n= 3\n\nTherefore, you bought 3 shirts."}

It is 20 degrees when she places it in the oven, and it heats up 5 degrees every minute. What temperature does it need to be before it is ready to eat? [/INST]  To determine the temperature the dish needs to be before it is ready to eat, we need to find out how many minutes it takes for the dish to reach 100 degrees.\n\nWe know that the dish starts at 20 degrees and heats up 5 degrees every minute. Therefore, we can find the number of minutes it takes to reach 100 degrees by dividing the difference between the starting temperature and the desired temperature (100 - 20 = 80) by the rate of increase (5 degrees per minute):\n\n80 / 5 = 16 minutes\n\nThis means that the dish needs to be in the oven for 16 minutes before it reaches the desired temperature of 100 degrees.\n\nTherefore, before it is ready to eat, the temperature of the dish needs to be 100 degrees."}
