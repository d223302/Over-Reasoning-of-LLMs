She went to a department store with a budget of $200 and spent $30 on a button-up shirt, $46 on suit pants, $38 on a suit coat, $11 on socks, and $18 on a belt. She also purchased a pair of shoes, but lost the receipt for them. She has $16 left from her budget. What was her budget when she went to the department store? Answer: 0\n\nThis question can be solved by first finding Alexis' total spending, then finding her total budget. To find her total spending, we add up the costs of all the items she bought: $30 + $46 + $38 + $11 + $18 = $173.\n\nNext 0 $200 = 1 \u2192 200 = 173.\n\nSince Alexis spent less than her total budget, she has a remaining balance of $16. Solving for her remaining balance, we subtract = 173 = 16 + 173 = 193.\n\nThus, Alexis' total spending was $193 and her remaining balance was $193. The initial value of her budget, $200, can be found by subtract 193 = 7 = 200 - 193. So the initial value of her budget was $100. Answer Answer Alexis bought 0 and spent 193 .

Every Friday, his number of borrowed books is about 40% higher than the daily average. How many books does he borrow on average every day? Answer: 40 books. Why: Let x be the number of books he borrows on a typical x day. Based on the problem statement, we can establish an algebraic equation: x = (40/7) \\* n x= (40/7) \\* n n is the number of borrowed on a typical day. Since he borrows books on Friday (40)%, he borrows 40x = (40/7) \\* 40 \u2248 500.0 books on a typical day. Solving for x, we get x = 500 \\* 4 \u2248 2000 books. Answer Krystian This is because the problem statement tells us that the number of books Krystian borrows on a typical day is 40 books. He borrows an additional 40% more books on Fridays, so he borrowseses 40 \\* 1.4 = 56 books on Friday. This means that the total number of books he borrows on Friday is 40 + 56 = 96 books. If the total number of books he borrows on a typical day is 2000, then the number of books he borrowses on a typical day is 2000 / 96 = 2097.67 books. Since we cannot have a fraction percentage percent of books in a fraction, this means that the maximum possible possible total number of books is 2097 books, which gives an answer answer.", "n_output": -1}

How far apart? How far apart apart? A.J. knows that the first thing he needs to do is use his knowledge of time and distance to find a way to solve the problem. The problem says the flight takes 5 hours and A.J. knows that time is measured in hours and minutes, so he can use his knowledge of time and distance to find the answer.\nFirst, A.J. converts the 5 hours to minutes by doubling the 5 and getting 10. Since the distance between the two cities is 10 hours and minutes, A.J. already knows what the answer will be because it is a multiple of 10. Therefore, he can answer the problem by saying: \u201cThe distance between the two cities is 10 hours and minutes.", "n_output": -1}

{"ground truth": 12.0, "prediction": "Question: Tommy is making 12 loaves of bread. He needs 4 pounds of flour per loaf. A 10-pound bag of flour costs $10 and a 12-pound bag costs $13. When he is done making his bread, he has no use for flour and so he will throw away whatever is left. How many loaves of bread is Tommy making? Answer: 4 pounds of flour per loaf means that Tommy needs 4 pounds of flour to make 1 loaf of bread. Since Tommy is making 12 loaves of bread, he needs 12 \\* 4 = <<12\\*\\*4=48>>48 pounds of flour. Since the 10-pound bag of flour costs $10 and the 12-pound bag of flour costs $13, Tommy will buy 48 / ($10/$13) = 6.667 bags and 6.67 bags, respectively. It is possible for Tommy to buy more than 48 pounds of flour, but at cost $10 and $13, it is not likely to do so. Tommy will have 48 / ($10/$13) + 6.67 bags of flour left over, which is equal to 48 + 6.67b. Since Tommy will waste whatever is left over, he will not use all of the flour.

{"ground truth": 10.0, "prediction": "Question: John decided to buy 10 pins for himself. They are normally $20 each but they were on sale for 15% off. How many pins did John decide to buy for himself? Answer: \u221a(10 x 120) = 10 x 0.85 = 8.5 pins Answer: The expression in the parentheses calculates the discount for the sale, then subtracts it to calculate the discount for the original price. Since the sale price is always 120% of the original price, dividing 20 by 120 gives 0.75 x 20 = 15. The discount for the sale is 10% (15/20 = 75%), after which the discount for the sale is 150% (15/20 = 150%). Applying this to the number of pins in the sale, they would sell for $20 (20% = 20), so they sell for 15 of them (75% = 67.47%). Answer: The fraction discount sold = 67.47 = 10 150/.75 = 75.4%. Answer: So 75.4% 67.47% = 0.41415080756887163289005640447265630886879029729076840357297838428212898790784316359109424462141120156794436907495527244823375907853996520518360947286691287162969510281532799407124434913677032015560321711501345917356177881574425040604762278071290386465613787901993", "n_output": -1}

No, some turtles lay more than others. Some of the turtles lay 40 eggs, some lay 60 eggs, and yet some lay 80 eggs. But, the total number of eggs can still only be 200 eggs.

However, with large numbers as in this case you can add up the number of eggs and subtract the average from 100 you'll have the total number of eggs. 100 - 6.7 = 93.3 eggs eggs This means that there are 93.3 eggs eggs of eggs in the nest eggs eggs eggs eggs eggs eggs eggs eggs eggs eggs eggs eggs eggs eggs eggs eggs eggs eggs eggs eggs eggs eggs eggs eggs eggs eggs eggs eggs eggs eggs eggs eggs eggs eggs eggs eggs eggs eggs eggs eggs eggs eggs eggs eggs eggs eggs eggs eggs eggs eggs eggs eggs eggs that can add up to 200 eggs eggs eggs total.

Answer: 45 minutes\nPrejean started at 45 minutes and finished at 90 minutes, which means that Rickey took 45 minutes to finish the race, and his speed was three-quarters of Prejean's speed. Since the race took one hour, and we know that Prejean's speed was three-quarters of Rickey's speed, we can solve for Rickey's speed in hours. We already know that Rickey took 45 minutes to finish the race, so we can find out what hour Rickey finished in by dividing 45 minutes by 60 (the number of minutes in an hour). This gives us 7.5 hours. However, since Rickey's speed is in minutes, we want to express this as hours, so we can divide 7.5 by 60 again to get 1.25 hours.

Answer: 30 years old.\nExplanation: We can set up an equation as follows:\nAge of Brian = Age of Christian + Number of years until Brian is 40\nWe know that Christian is twice as old as Brian, so we can divide both sides by 2:\nAge of Brian = Age of Christian / 2\nWe also know that for every two years that pass, Brian will be 40 years old. There are 40 years from now. So we can say:\nAge of Brian in 40 years = 40\\*(40+2*40) = 40\\*(110) = 4400\nWe can write this as:\nAge of Brian in 40 years = 40\\*(110)\nSo the equation can be:\nAge of Brian in 40 years = 40\\*(110)\nThis means that:\n(10) is equal to (110)\nAnd (40\\*(110)) is equal to (110) or (4400)\nSince the value of the equation is the same with the value of the first number in the first expression is true and therefore the equation equation must be (40\\*(110)) = (110)\nThis is because when you multiply a number by a fraction (10) 40\\*(10) the number will become 40 times the number the fraction it was multiplied with (10) 40*10 = 400 40\\*4 = 160 10*40 = 400 100*2 = 200 0.25*8 = 2\\*8 etc.", "n_output": -1}

{"ground truth": 8.0, "prediction": "Question: Marcus takes a deck of standard playing cards and takes out all the face cards and the 8's. Mark picks a card at random and then replaces it 36 times. How many cards did Marcus take out from the deck? Answer: 8-8 = 0, so the number of face cards and 8's in the original deck were 0 . Now, we can use the principle of totals to solve this problem: Mark takes one card from the deck, puts it back, then takes another card, puts it back, and so on. Therefore, the total number of cards taken out (number) from the deck by Marcus is given by the recurrence rule: Let T(n) = the total number of cards taken out from the deck, at the n-th iteration and Mark takes one card from the deck, then puts it back. Then, T(1) is the number of face cards and 8's in the deck. Since there were 0 of them to begin with, we have T(1) = 0. Now, Mark takes one more card, puts it back, and so on, in each iteration iteration iteration iteration iteration iteration iteration iteration iteration iteration iteration iteration iteration iteration iteration iteration . At this point, we can compute that the total running total to be zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero of T(1) = 0 + T(1) = 0.\nEach time we repeat repeat repeat repeat repeat repeat repeat repeat repeat repeat repeat repeat repeat repeat repeat repeat repeat repeat plus one, this will be four-tuple 0000, and at the end of the process, after 36 iterations total total total total, the total total number of cards that have been removed from the deck deck will be, the number of face cards and 8s included in the original deck deck deck deck deck deck deck deck deck deck deck deck deck deck number is 0.0, and the number of distinct integers from 1 to 36 is number of distinct integers from 0 to 36, which is: 36 3 1 6 16 15 7 11 14 2 12 19 5 18 3 2 2 1 1 1 2 8 = 363 16 14 9 15 7 4 1 0 1 2 11 14 8 10 12 17 2 2 0 0 1 1 ", "n_output": -1}
