In other words, the 76th week will yield a total capacity of 1024 objects, followed by the 77th week (1048 objects), the 78th week (1072 objects), and so on. The rule of 75 is especially interesting within the context of juggling since it offers predictions predictions, as the juggling objects will double with each consecutive week.\nJeanette is practicing her juggling skills. Each week she is able to juggle more objects than in the week before. How much more is she able to juggle each week?"}

However, at the store, Lilith realized she could not sell at $2 because the regular price was $1.85 per water bottle in her town, and she had to reduce her price to $1.85 as well to sell her water bottles. How much does Lilith need to sell each water bottle for in order to get exactly enough money to buy her friend a birthday gift? Answer: 1.85 each. Lilith needs to sell at 1.85 for each bottle to get exactly enough money to buy her friend a birthday gift. This works out as - Lilith needs to sell 1.85 x 5 dozen = 9.70. She would need to sell 9.70 x 5 dozen = 47.35 to receive a total of 50.05 . In turn, she needs to receive a total of 50.05 . Thus, she cannot earn the exact amount of 50.05 as it exceeds the quantity of bottles needed as well as their price. So, the answer is 50.05 bottles. 1 bottle=1.85 and 5 bottles= 5 x 1.85 = 9.70. 9.70 bottles = 9.70 x 1.85 = 1.85. Thus, the total is 50.05, which exceeds 47 bottles. 50.05 = 50.05. 47.35 bottles"}

How many books does Harry have in his library? Answer: 50 books. Harry has 50 books in his library. His sister Flora has double the number of books, meaning that Harry's number of books is equal to his sister's number of books plus Gary's number of books. 50 + (25 + 25) = 75, so Harry has 75 books in his library. The equation can be simplified as 50 + 25 + 25 = 75, which can be rearranged as 50 + 25 + 25 = 75, or as 50 + 2x = 75, where 2x represents the x number of books. 25 + 25 = 50, so 25 is the x number of books. 2 + 2 = 5, where 5 is the x number of books, and 2 = 25, or the x number of books is 25.

He is amused by letting the water run for 1 minute, then closing the water supply for 1 minute, and so on alternating opening and closing the water supply. But the cap at the bottom of the tub is not very airtight and lets 1 liter of water escape per minute. The flow rate of the tap is 12 liters per minute. How many liters does Robi Ney want to fill the tub with? Answer: 108 liters.\nGiven that the cap is not very airtight and let 1 liter of water escape per minute, and the tap is supplying 12 liters of water per minute, we need to calculate the number of minutes it will take for Robi Ney to fill the tub. 12 liters per minute * 5 minutes per 12 liters = 60 minutes. Therefore, it will take Robi Ney 45 (1/60) minutes or 7.5 hours to fill the tub. Substituting the numbers, 108 liters = 12 liters * 8 hours = 96 liters, so Robi Ney will need an additional 96 liters from the tap. 96 liters + 60 minutes = 156 minutes. Thus, it will take Robi Ney 156 minutes or 27 hours to fill the tub to capacity (108 liters)."}

{"ground truth": 14.0, "prediction": "Question: In a zoo, a hare is 14 inches tall, while a camel is 24 times taller than the hare. How tall is the hare in inches? Answer: 14 inches. Note: This question is a good demonstration of how multiplication and division work. Multiplication works by multiplying the units together: 14 inches = (14 inches) = 1 x 14 inches = 100%. Division works by dividing the units: 14 inches = 24/14 inches = 1.74 square inches = 100/14 percentage. Hence, even if a hare is 14 inches tall in a zoo, it is only 1.74 square inches tall, equivalent to 100/14 percentage."}

Answer: 75 clovers, 150 clovers with four leaves, and 225 clovers with four purple leaves.\nThis problem has two parts.

What is the speed at which Toby, the Alaskan Malamute, can pull a sled if the sled is unloaded? Answer: 20 miles per hour. This is because any object travels slower when it is loaded compared to when it is unloaded. More specifically, the sled's speed was calculated from the relationship between the sled's mass, the rope\u2019s length, and the dog\u2019s pull force: m * s = Fd * (l - m) Where \u201cm\u201d is the sled's mass, \u201cs\u201d is the rope\u2019s length, \u201cFd\u201d is the dog\u2019s pull force, and \u201cl\u201d is the sled's unloaded mass. From this relationship, when the sled is unloaded, the sled's speed is 20 miles per hour. When the sled is loaded, the sled's speed is 10 miles per hour. Therefore, the maximum speed of Toby, the Alaskan Malamute, is 20 miles per hour when the sled is unloaded, and 10 miles per hour when the sled is loaded.

In the final game Duke made 5 free throws (worth one point), and 4 regular baskets (worth two points), and some three-pointers. Normally, he scores 2 three-pointers a game. How many more points does he need to tie the record? Answer: 257 = 5 points + 4 baskets + (2 x 3pt) x 4 shots. So he needs to make 4 more baskets than the old record to tie the record. In his last game, he made 5 baskets. So he needs to make 5 additional baskets to tie the record. That means he needs to make 5 more baskets than the old record in his last game. That makes it much easier for him to tie the record. He can make 5 more baskets in his last game than the old record and then he ties the record.

The home goods store will pay the moving company a $100 fee, plus $3 for every bowl that is delivered safely. Travis must pay the home goods store $4 each for any bowls that are lost or broken. How many bowls is Travis hired to take from the factory to the home goods store? Answer: 638\nThis is a combination of a linear and non-linear problem. Firstly, we need to work out how many bowls Travis is hired to take (638). To do this, we need to subtract the number of bowls that Travis will lose or break (4 = $4 for any bowls that are lost or broken). This leaves us with the number of bowls Travis is hired to take (634). We can then convert this number into a problem that can be solved using linear algebra to calculate the total cost. This is done by multiplying the number of bowls with the fee for each (1) and adding the number of bowls (634) that are lost or broken (4). This gives us the total cost (1724)."}

One of Thomas's friends doesn't like chocolate bars very much and returns 5 of his bars to the box. Later, his sister Piper comes home and takes 5 fewer bars than those taken in total by Thomas and his friends so she can also share with her friends. How many bars does a chocolate box contain? Answer: 182 bars.\nThis problem can be solved by first identifying how many bars each person take, including Thomas's friend who does not like chocolate bars and returns 5 of his bars. We know Thomas and his friends take 1/4 of the bars (182/200) and Thomas's friend returns 5 bars, meaning the remaining bars are 182 - 5 = 177. Piper takes 5 fewer bars than the number taken by Thomas and his friends, meaning she takes 177 - 14 = 163 bars. Therefore, 120 bars are taken by Thomas and his friends, and 163 bars are taken by Piper leaving a remaining of 182 - 163 = 19 bars. Therefore, a chocolate box contains 182 bars."}

{"ground truth": 8.0, "prediction": "Question: Sammy has 8 gifts to wrap. Each gift requires 1.5 meters of ribbon. Unfortunately, she has no available ribbon so Tom let her use his 15-meter long ribbon. How many gifts does Sammy have to wrap? Answer: 4. 1.5 meters of ribbon is equal to 0.015 meters, which is roughly equal to 5mm in length. Since Tom's 15-meter ribbon is 10 times bigger than Sammy's requirement, she only has to wrap 4 gifts. This is because 4 gifts can be wrapped without any remaining ribbon. 8 x 0.015 = 12mm = 4 remaining remaining ribbon. So Sammy still needs 4 gifts to be wrapped. (15-10) = 5mm + 4 = 19mm, which is the length of ribbon Sammy needs to wrap 8 gifts. 15 + 0.015 = 1.5 + 5mm = 5.5mm, which is the length of ribbon Tom needs to offer Sammy to wrap the 8 gifts. 0.015 + 1.5 = 1.5 + 5mm = 6.5mm, which is the length of ribbon Sammy need.

Both his car and his motorcycle get 35 miles per gallon of gas and the commute to work is 14 miles. Gas costs him $3.75 per gallon. Geordie drives his car to work three times a week and his motorcycle to work twice a week. What is the toll per car? Answer: 0.33, or $12.50 per car. Question 2.5: What is the toll per motorcycle? Answer: 0.18, or $7 per motorcycle. This is because the toll is based on the cost of the cars, and since cars and motorcycles are both taxed at the same rate, the toll is divided by three if there are three cars (three tolls) or divided by two if there are two cars (two tolls). Since Geordie is driving his car three times and motorcycle twice, the toll is divided by three (12.5) for the car and by two (7.5) for the motorcycle. This is because the ratio of three tolls is $37.5 to $12.5 and the ratio of two tolls is $18 to $7.5. This ratio of three cars and two motorcycles and then car and motorcycle divides the total amount 37.5 and 43.75, respectively respectively and half and half. #MATH"}
