Let's calculate the rate of increase of speed per day:\nRate of increase in speed (M/H) = (10M - 0N) * 50% = 5M/N.\nSo, Harry runs 5M/N meters per hour faster than he ran on Monday. But, from Tuesday to Friday, he runs 60% faster than he ran on Thursday, so 6M/N meters per hour. Therefore, from Tuesday to Friday, he runs 60% faster than Monday, so he runs 6M/N meters per hour faster than Monday. Therefore, Harry runs 11.5 meters per hour on Friday, and 7.75 meters per hour on Thursday. So, his running speed increases 60% each day. From Tuesday, he runs 60% faster than Monday, so he runs 6M/N meters per hour faster than Monday. 6M/N - 0M/N = 6M/N meters per hour faster than Monday.

The products are very delicate and must be carefully packed, so partially filled boxes can\u2019t be shipped. Steven has three trucks that can be sent on each delivery. Each truck can carry a load of no more than 2,000 pounds of cargo. Some of the boxes weigh 10 pounds after being packed, and some of the boxes weigh 40 pounds when packed. Steven\u2019s customer has ordered equal quantities of both the lighter and heavier products. What is the maximum number of pounds of cargo that each truck can carry? Answer: 2,000 pounds. Explanation: The maximum number of pounds of cargo that each truck can carry is 2,000 pounds. This is calculated by taking into account the weight of the products (10 pounds for the lighter products and 40 pounds for the heavier products). Therefore the total weight of the products is 1,900 pounds. However, each truck can only carry 2,000 pounds of cargo, so the difference of 1,000 pounds must be evenly dispersed between the three trucks. Each truck can then carry 300 pounds of products."}

{"ground truth": 2.0, "prediction": "Question: A restaurant is offering a fundraiser one day where they donate $2 for every $10  donated by customers. The average customer donates 3 and there are 40 customers that day. How much does the restaurant donate for every $10 donated by customers? Answer: 60. \nFor example, if the customer donates $10 then the restaurant will donate another $60 to their chosen charity.  This is because 3 (average customer donation) x 40 (customers) = 1200 and since 1200 is not divisible by 10, it means that 100, 200, 300, 400 etc. are the respective amounts that the restaurant will donate for different customer donations.  Therefore, if the customer donates 10, the restaurant will donate 60; if the customer donates 20, the restaurant will donate 120; and so on."}
