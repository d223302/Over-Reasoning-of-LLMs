{"ground truth": 847.0, "prediction": "To calculate the number of people the deep-sea monster has consumed over three hundred years, we need to consider that the number of people on each ship doubles with each new ship.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\nTo find the number of people on the first ship, we can set it as 'x.'\nOn the second ship, there would be twice as many people, so the number of people would be '2x.'\nOn the third ship, it would be double the number of people on the second ship, which gives '4x.'\nThis pattern continues for each ship, so the number of people on the nth ship would be '2^(n-1) * x.'\n\nSo, over the three hundred years, we need to sum up the number of people on each ship. We can represent this as a series:\n\nx + 2x + 4x + 8x + ... + (2^(300-1) * x)\n\nTo simplify this series, we can use the formula for the sum of a geometric series:\n\nSum = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r)\n\nIn this case, 'a' represents the first term of the series (x), 'r' represents the common ratio (2), and 'n' represents the number of terms (300).\n\nUsing the formula:\n\nSum = x * (1 - 2^300) / (1 - 2)\n\nSimplifying:\n\nSum = x * (1 - 2^300) / (-1)\n\nFinally, we know that over the three hundred years, the monster has consumed 847 people. So:\n\nSum = 847\n\nx * (1 - 2^300) / (-1) = 847\n\nx * (2^300 - 1) = 847\n\nNow we need to find the value of 'x' that satisfies this equation. Since the question doesn't provide more information about the initial number of people, it's difficult to determine this value without assumptions or additional data.\n\nTherefore, without the specific value of 'x,' we cannot accurately calculate the total number of people the deep-sea monster has consumed over the three hundred years.", "n_output": 443}

He charges $15 to mow a lawn, and since we don't have the exact number of lawns he mowed, we will denote the number of lawns as 'x'. So the earnings from mowing lawns are 15x dollars.\n\nSimilarly, Tobias charges $7 to shovel a driveway. Let's denote the number of driveways he shoveled as 'y'. Therefore, the earnings from shoveling driveways would be 7y dollars.\n\nThe total earnings Tobias made from mowing lawns and shoveling driveways are 15x + 7y dollars.\n\nAfter buying the shoes, Tobias has $15 in change, which means the total amount he had before buying the shoes was 15 + $95 (cost of shoes). Therefore, his total savings before buying the shoes would be 15 + 95 = $110.\n\nEquating this total savings to the sum of his allowance savings, lawn-mowing earnings, and driveway-shoveling earnings, we get the equation:\n\n15 + 95 = 15x + 7y\n\nSimplifying the equation, we have:\n\n110 = 15x + 7y\n\nUnfortunately, without knowing the exact number of lawns mowed and driveways shoveled, we cannot determine the precise cost of the shoes.", "n_output": 357}

{"ground truth": 50.0, "prediction": "To determine the percentage of germs that one spray kills, we need to calculate the combined effect of both sprays on the germs. \n\nLet's assume that there are 100 germs in total. \n\nThe first spray kills 50% of germs, which means it kills 50% of the 100 germs, resulting in 50 germs being killed. \n\nThe second spray kills 25% of germs, which means it kills 25% of the remaining germs after the first spray, which is 50 germs. So, it kills 25% of 50 germs, resulting in 12.5 germs being killed. \n\nNow, since 5% of the germs killed by both sprays are the same ones, we subtract this overlapping number from the total number of germs killed. \n\nThe overlapping germs would be 5% of the total germs killed, which is 5% of (50 + 12.5) germs, equal to 3.125 germs. \n\nTherefore, the total number of germs killed by both sprays, without counting the overlapping germs, is 50 + 12.5 germs - 3.125 germs = 59.375 germs. \n\nTo calculate the percentage of germs killed by one spray, we divide the total number of germs killed by both sprays by the total number of germs initially. \n\nSo, the percentage of germs killed by one spray is (59.375 germs / 100 germs) x 100% = 59.375%. \n\nTherefore, one spray kills approximately 59.375% of germs.", "n_output": 348}

If the chances of getting infected with malaria after being bitten by an infected mosquito while being vaccinated are 25%, then we can deduce that 25% of the 40% of infected mosquitoes will cause transmission of the malaria virus.\n\nTherefore, the percentage of mosquitos in Jack's area that are infected with malaria is 25% of 40%, which equals 10%.\n\nSo, 10% of the mosquitos in Jack's area are infected with malaria.", "n_output": 245}

Therefore, she must have had 8 x 2 = 16 cookies on the second day.\n\nSimilarly, on the second day, she ate half of the remaining cookies from the first day. So, she must have had 16 x 2 = 32 cookies on the first day.\n\nSince she ate three-quarters of the bag of cookies on the first day, we can calculate the total number of cookies she had initially.

To calculate the amount after 3 years, we can use the formula for compound interest:\n\nA = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)\n\nWhere:\nA = the final amount\nP = the principal amount\nr = the annual interest rate (as a decimal)\nn = the number of times that interest is compounded per year\nt = the number of years\n\nUsing the formula, we can calculate the amount after 3 years:\n\nA = 10000(1 + 0.20/1)^(1*3)\nA = 10000(1 + 0.20)^3\nA = 10000(1.20)^3\nA = 10000(1.728)\nA = 17,280\n\nSo, after 3 years, Sam's investment grew to $17,280.\n\nNext, it is mentioned that Sam then invested more until he had three times as much invested. Let's say he invested an additional amount, x. So, his total investment would be 3 times the initial investment:\n\nTotal Investment = Initial Investment + Additional Investment\n3 * 10,000 = 10,000 + x\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n30,000 = 10,000 + x\n\nx = 30,000 - 10,000\nx = 20,000\n\nTherefore, Sam invested an additional $20,000 to have a total investment of $30,000.\n\nIn the following year, Sam earned a 15% return on his investment of $30,000. To calculate the return, we can use the formula:\n\nReturn = Investment * Rate\n\nReturn = 30,000 * 0.15\nReturn = 4,500\n\nHence, Sam received a return of $4,500 on his investment of $30,000.", "n_output": 412}

It states that there were 5 fewer songs than the hit songs that were never released. So if we subtract 5 from the total number of hit songs (25), we find that there were 25 - 5 = 20 songs that were never released.\n\nSince we now have the numbers for the top 10 songs, the top 100 songs, and the unreleased songs, we can calculate the number of hit songs that made it on the top 10 charts.

The rental rate for weekdays (Thursday and Friday) is $420 per day, while the weekend rental rate (Saturday and Sunday) is $540 per day. \n\nTo calculate the total rental cost, we need to separate the weekdays and weekends:\nWeekday rental cost = $420/day * 2 days = $840\nWeekend rental cost = $540/day * 2 days = $1080\n\nNow, to split the rental cost evenly among Suzie and her friends, we need to divide the total rental cost by the number of people. Let's represent the number of friends as \"x\" (excluding Suzie):\nTotal rental cost = ($840 + $1080) / (x + 1)\n\nSince they all decided to split it evenly, the total rental cost should also be evenly divisible by the number of people:\n($840 + $1080) % (x + 1) = 0\n\nWe need to find a value for \"x\" that satisfies this condition. Let's start by testing different values for \"x\" to find the one that makes the total rental cost evenly divisible.\n\nFor example, if x = 2 (Suzie + 2 friends):\nTotal rental cost = ($840 + $1080) / (2 + 1) = $1920 / 3 = $640\n\nSince $640 is not evenly divisible by 3, we can conclude that Suzie and her friends are not splitting the rental cost evenly. Therefore, Suzie did not decide to rent an Airbnb with 2 friends.\n\nWe need to continue testing different values for \"x\" until we find the one that makes the total rental cost evenly divisible. Let's try x = 4 (Suzie + 4 friends):\nTotal rental cost = ($840 + $1080) / (4 + 1) = $1920 / 5 = $384\n\nSince $384 is evenly divisible by 5 (the number of people, including Suzie), we have found the solution.

This means that 40% of her earnings is equal to $100.\n\nSo, we can set up the following equation: 0.4 * X = $100, where X is the amount of money Ella made from babysitting.\n\nTo solve for X, we divide both sides of the equation by 0.4: X = $100 / 0.4 = $250.\n\nThis means that Ella made $250 from babysitting last year.\n\nNow, we need to find out how much Ella spends on video games after receiving a 10% raise this year.

{"ground truth": 804.0, "prediction": "To find the total number of senior high school students, we need to determine the fraction of students who passed their exams. \n\nIf 75% of the students passed their exams, it means that the remaining 25% failed. \n\nLet's calculate the number of students who failed:\n\n25% of 804 = (25/100) * 804 = 201\n\nTherefore, there were 201 senior high school students who failed their exams. \n\nTo find the total number of students, we can add the number of students who passed and the number of students who failed:\n\nNumber of students who passed + Number of students who failed = Total number of students\n\n804 + 201 = 1005\n\nTherefore, there were 1005 senior high school students in total.", "n_output": 156}
{"ground truth": 180.0, "prediction": "According to the given information, a hammerhead shark has 1/6 the number of teeth that a tiger shark has. This means a hammerhead shark has (1/6) x 180 = 30 teeth.\nAlso, a great white shark has double the sum of teeth of a tiger shark and a hammerhead shark. So, a great white shark has 2 x (180 + 30) = 420 teeth.\nTherefore, a tiger shark has 180 teeth.", "n_output": 98}
