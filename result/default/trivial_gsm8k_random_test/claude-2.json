{"ground truth": 3.0, "prediction": " * Ryan gets $6 allowance for each week he completes his chores\n* He did his chores for 3 weeks, so he earned 3 * $6 = $18\n* He bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends at $1.25 each. So that's 4 cones at $1.25 per cone, which is 4 * $1.25 = $5\n* He spent $5 on ice cream cones\n* Movie tickets cost $6.50 each. Since there are 4 people, 4 * $6.50 = $26 for the movie tickets\n* Ryan had $18 originally. He spent $5 on ice cream, so he has $18 - $5 = $13 left\n* The movie tickets cost $26. Since Ryan has $13 left, he does not have enough money from 3 weeks of allowance to buy the movie tickets.\n* Therefore, the number of weeks Ryan did chores must be less than 3.\n\nThe question asks how many weeks did he do chores for, not how many more weeks he needs. So based on the information given, the number of weeks Ryan did chores is 3."}
