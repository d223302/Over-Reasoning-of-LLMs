So, we need to find out how much money Billy has left after buying the candy. \n\nLet's assume Billy spent $x on candy. This means he has $10 - $x left. \n\nHe then spends half of this amount on gumballs, which cost $0.05 each. \n\nSo, we have the equation: \n\n($10 - $x) / 2 = $0.05 \n\nTo solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2: \n\n$10 - $x = $0.05 * 2 \n\n$10 - $x = $0.10 \n\nNow, let's isolate x by subtracting $10 from both sides: \n\n-$x = $0.10 - $10 \n\n-$x = -$9.90 \n\nDividing both sides by -1 will give us the value of x: \n\nx = $9.90 \n\nTherefore, Billy spent $9.90 on candy. \n\nNow, we can calculate the cost of each gumball by dividing the money spent on gumballs by the number of gumballs purchased. \n\nBilly has $10 - $9.90 = $0.10 left after buying the candy. \n\nSince each gumball costs $0.05, we can divide $0.10 by $0.05 to find out how many gumballs Billy bought: \n\n$0.10 / $0.05 = 2 \n\nTherefore, Billy bought 2 gumballs. \n\nNow, we can calculate the cost of each gumball: \n\n$9.90 / 2 = $4.95 \n\nTherefore, each gumball costs $4.95."]}

Since each bag of chips costs 40 cents, the total cost of the chips would be 3 * 40 = 120 cents or 1.20 dollars.\nGeorge also bought candy bars, so the remaining money would be 5 - 1.20 = 3.80 dollars.\nSince George had 1% of his money left, this means 1% of his money is equal to 0.01 * 3.80 = 0.038 dollars.\nTherefore, George spent x + 1.20 dollars on chips, and this amount is equal to 3.80 + 0.038 dollars.\nSimplifying the equation, we have x + 1.20 = 3.80 + 0.038.\nSubtracting 1.20 from both sides, we get x = 3.80 + 0.038 - 1.20.\nSimplifying the right side of the equation, we have x = 2.62.\nTherefore, George spent 2.62 dollars on chips.", "Let's denote the cost of a bag of chips as \"c\" and the cost of a candy bar as \"b\". \n\nFrom the given information, we know that a bag of chips costs 40 cents, so we can write the equation c = 40. Similarly, we know that a candy bar costs 75 cents, so we can write the equation b = 75.\n\nGeorge spent $5, so we can write the equation 3c + nb = 500, where n represents the number of candy bars George bought.\n\nWe also know that George had 1% of his money left, which means he spent 99% of his money. So we can write the equation 3c + nb + 0.01(500) = 500.\n\nSubstituting the values of c and b, we have 3(40) + n(75) + 0.01(500) = 500.\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get 120 + 75n + 5 = 500.\n\nCombining like terms, we have 75n + 125 = 500.\n\nSubtracting 125 from both sides, we get 75n = 375.\n\nDividing both sides by 75, we get n = 5.\n\nTherefore, George bought 5 candy bars.\n\nTo find out how much money George spent, we substitute the values of c and n into the equation: 3(40) + 5(75) = $120 + $375 = $495.\n\nSo, George spent $495."]}

Of those who receive a job offer, a third (or 33.33%) accept the position.\n\nLet's assume the number of people who apply for a job at Google is represented by \"x.\"\n\nOut of those \"x\" applicants, 30% receive interviews, which is 0.3x.\n\nOut of those 0.3x who receive interviews, 20% receive a job offer, which is 0.2 * 0.3x = 0.06x.\n\nOut of those 0.06x who receive a job offer, a third accept the position, which is 0.33 * 0.06x = 0.0198x.\n\nTherefore, the number of people who apply for a job at Google (x) is approximately equal to 0.0198x.\n\nTo solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.0198:\n\nx = x/0.0198\n\nSimplifying this equation gives us:\n\n1 = 1/0.0198\n\nSo, approximately 1/0.0198 = 50.51.\n\nTherefore, approximately 50.51 people apply for a job at Google.

So, if we let x represent the number of people who receive interviews, then 30% of the total number of people who apply is x. Mathematically, it can be written as:\n\n0.3 * total number of people who apply = x\n\nNext, we know that 20% of the people who receive interviews receive a job offer. So, if we let y represent the number of people who receive a job offer, then 20% of the total number of people who receive interviews is y. Mathematically, it can be written as:\n\n0.2 * x = y\n\nFinally, we know that a third of the people who receive a job offer accept the position. So, if we let z represent the number of people who accept the position, then a third of the total number of people who receive a job offer is z. Mathematically, it can be written as:\n\n(1/3) * y = z\n\nNow we can solve these equations simultaneously to find the value of x, which represents the total number of people who apply for a job at Google.", "Let's break down the information given step by step:\n\n- Of the people who apply, only 30% receive interviews.\nSo, if we let \"x\" be the number of people who apply for a job, then 30% of x receive interviews.\n\n- Of those who receive interviews, 20% receive a job offer.\nThis means that if \"y\" is the number of people who receive interviews, then 20% of y receive a job offer.\n\n- Of those who receive a job offer, a third of the people accept the position.\nSo, if \"z\" is the number of people who receive a job offer, then a third of z accept the position.\n\nBased on the given information, we can set up the following equations:\n\nx * 0.30 = y (number of people who receive interviews)\ny * 0.20 = z (number of people who receive a job offer)\nz * (1/3) = number of people who accept the job\n\nWe want to find the value of \"x\" (number of people who apply for a job at Google).\n\nFrom the first equation, we can solve for y:\ny = x * 0.30\n\nSubstituting this into the second equation, we can solve for z:\nz = (x * 0.30) * 0.20\n\nFinally, substituting this into the third equation, we can solve for the number of people who accept the job:\n(number of people who accept the job) = ((x * 0.30) * 0.20) * (1/3)\n\nGiven that the number of people who accept the job is a third of the number of people who receive a job offer, we can rewrite the equation as:\n(number of people who accept the job) = (x * 0.30) * 0.20 * (1/3)\n\nNow we can solve for the value of x:\n(number of people who accept the job) = (x * 0.30) * 0.20 * (1/3)\n(number of people who accept the job) = x * 0.30 * 0.20 * (1/3)\n(number of people who accept the job) = x * 0.02\n\nSince the number of people who accept the job is given as a third of the number of people who receive a job offer, we can rewrite the equation as:\n(number of people who receive a job offer) * (1/"]}

Initially, there were 120 people on the train, and 20 more people boarded at the first stop, so the total number of people after the first stop is 120 + 20 = 140 people.\n\nThen, at the second stop, 50 people descended, so the total number of people after the second stop is 140 - 50 = 90 people.\n\nSince 100 people boarded the train at the second stop, the number of people on the train after the third stop is 90 + 100 = 190 people.\n\nTherefore, the number of people who descended at the third station is 190 - 120 = 70 people.", "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.\n\nRomeo boards a train with 120 people.\nAt the first stop, 20 more people board the train.\nSo now there are 120 + 20 = 140 people on the train.\n\nAt the second stop, 50 people descended from the train while twice that number boarded the train.\nSo 50 people left the train, leaving 140 - 50 = 90 people on the train.\nTwice that number boarded the train, which means 2 * 50 = 100 people boarded.\n\nTherefore, after the second stop, there are 90 + 100 = 190 people on the train.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many more people descended at the third station.\nUnfortunately, the number of people who descended at the third station is not given in the problem statement.", "To solve this problem, let's keep track of the number of people on the train at each stop.\n\nAt the first stop, 20 more people boarded the train, so the total number of people on the train is now 120 + 20 = 140.\n\nAt the second stop, 50 people descended from the train, so the total number of people on the train is now 140 - 50 = 90. \n\nTwice the number of people who descended, 50 x 2 = 100, boarded the train. So, the total number of people on the train is now 90 + 100 = 190.\n\nTo find out how many more people descended at the third station, we subtract the number of people who boarded at the third station from the total number of people on the train after the second stop. \n\n190 - 100 = 90.\n\nTherefore, 90 more people descended at the third station."]}
