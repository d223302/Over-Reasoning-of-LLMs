Then the length is 2x - 1 meters = 2x - 1.\n\n\nNow, we are asked to find the difference in length between the width and twice the width. To find this, we can subtract the width from twice the width: \n\n\nTwice width - width. \n\nSubstituting x for the width, we get:\n\n\n2x - x = x + 1.\n\n\nSimplifying this, we get:\n\n\n2x = x + 1. \n\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\n\nx = 2"}

Let's assume SF = 25 for this example.\n\n\nThe running current required by each unit of machinery is:\n\n\nI_running = I_start / SF\nI_start = 40A / 25\nI_start = 1.6A (rounded to the nearest 0.1A)\n\n\nTherefore, each unit of machinery requires 1.6A of running current."}
