Since strawberries are sold in 2 cup packages and Martha needs 4 cups for each quart of ice cream, she will need 2 packages of strawberries for 1 quart of ice cream. If strawberries cost $3.00 per package then 2 packages cost $3.00 x 2 = $6.00.

If raspberries cost $5.00 per package then 2 packages cost $5.00 x 2 = $10.00. So Martha will pay $10.00 for 1 quart of raspberry ice cream and $6.00 for 1 quart of strawberry ice cream. In total, Martha will pay $10.00 + $6.00 = $16.00 for the ingredients to make 2 quarts of ice cream.
