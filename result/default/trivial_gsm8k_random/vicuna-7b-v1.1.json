So the percentage off is 5400% / 5000% = 5400 / 5000 = 10800%"}

Answer: 50 grams.\n\nExplanation:\nTo find the number of grams of gold that Anna has, we need to solve for the number of grams of gold by subtracting the cost of gold in grams from the number of grams of gold in the given information or by adding the cost of gold in dollars to the given information.\n\nThe number of grams of gold is given as 50 grams and this number is the same whether the information is written with grams or with dollars in the same or with grams or with dollars\n\nSo the number of grams of gold is 50 grams or 15 grams + 20 grams = 35 grams.\nSince Anna has 50 grams of gold, she has 50 grams or 35 grams of gold if the information is written with grams or with dollars\n\nThe weight of gold depends on the number of grams that is the same whether the weight of gold is written in the problem in grams or in dollars.

Brad drank 5 and sold 2 but he could have sold 20 glasses if he had sold all the lemonade he had available. In order to find out how many glasses he would have sold if he had sold all the lemonade, you need to multiply the number of glasses he sold by how many glasses he had left over. 5 x 2 = 10. 0 x 10 = 0. since 10 > 0, the result is 10 but the answer is 10 glasses per gall gall."}

{"ground truth": 20.0, "prediction": "Question: Keanu was surfing towards the shore at a speed of 20 miles per hour. A shark was swimming alongside him, riding the same wave, when it doubled its speed and moved away from Keanu. There was a pilot fish swimming alongside Keanu and the shark, and when the shark increased its speed, the pilot fish also increased its speed and moved away from Keanu, but only increasing its speed by half as much as the shark had increased its speed by. What was Keanu's speed while surfing towards the shore? Answer: 16 miles per hour. The shark's speed when it increased its speed was x, and when it doubled its speed, its speed was x + x/2, so its speed when it moved away from Keanu was x + x(2)/2, which is equal to x + x/2. The pilot fish's speed was y, and its speed when it moved away from Keanu was y + y(2)/2, which is equal to y + y/2. Finally, the total speed of Keanu when he moved away from the shark and the piloto is 2x + 2y + x + y + x/2 + y/2 = 2(x+y + x/2 + y/2) = 20/2 = 10.

One lap around the school is 100 meters. The winner is awarded a gift certificate equal to $3.5 for every one hundred meters they run. The winner runs 24 laps around the school. How many minutes do the participants have to run laps around the school to determine the winner? Answer: 12 minutes.\nThe winner runs 24 laps around the school. That means the winner runs 2400 meters. Since the winner is awarded $3.5 for every one hundred meters they run, that means the winner is awarded 2400 \\* $3.5 = $<<2400*3.5=8600>>86000. Since the prize is only for running laps around the school and not for time, that means the participants have to run 8600 meters in 12 minutes.

What is the average pace of the first runner? Answer: 6 minutes per mile. If the first runner runs 6 more minutes, then the total time they run is 2x15/60. Let x be the total time run by both runners. Then the total time ran by both runners is 15x/60, because the first runner runs for 15x/60 minutes, and the second runner starts at time 56 and stops at time 56+x, for a total running time of 56+(15x/60) = 15x/60 + 56 = 2x15/60. The sum of their times is therefore 2x15/60, the time the slower runner takes to run 2x15/60. The faster runner runs in 2x15/60 - 6 = 19x/60 minutes, which adds to the slower runner's time, so the total time for both runners is 6 more in 19x/60 minutes = 6x/30 -6= (6/30)*x/12 = (6/30)x/2 ="}

Machine A can put caps on 12 bottles, Machine B can put caps on 11 bottles, and Machine C can put caps on 16 bottles. Let x be the number of bottles that Machine A can put caps on in 1 minute.\n\nSince Machine A can put caps on 12 bottles, Machine A can put caps on 12 bottles - 2 = 10 bottles in 1 minute because it can put caps on 1 less bottle than Machine A. This is because the rate at which Machine A puts caps on bottles is 12 bottles/1 minute, and the rate at which Machine B puts caps on bottles is 11 bottles/1 minute.\n\nSince Machine A puts caps on 10 bottles in 1 minute, Machine B puts caps on 10 bottles - 2 = 8 bottles in 1 minute because it can put caps on 1 less bottle than Machine A. This is because the rate at which Machine B puts caps"}
