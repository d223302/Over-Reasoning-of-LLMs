{"ground truth": 5.0, "prediction": "Question: Tobias is buying a new pair of shoes that costs $95. He has been saving up his money each month for the past three months. He gets a $5 allowance a month. He also mows lawns and shovels driveways. He charges $15 to mow a lawn and $7 to shovel. After buying the shoes, he has $15 in change. How much is his monthly allowance? \\nAnswer: The problem can\u2019t really be solved with integer variables. After buying the new shoes, Tobias only has $15 in change and it really doesn\u2019t say how much his monthly allowance is. This is why the problem is an inequality, since Tobias only has $15 the number of days can either be positive or negative, so a real number can be used instead of an integer. Also, Tobias has to spend a total of $135, so to find how many days it will take to spend $135 we can use the substitution method. Substitution method for money problems is really easy to follow. A substitution function is an equation that transforms a money problem into a polynomial equation. To know how much money you\u2019ll need to spend to buy something you\u2019ll first have to find out how much something costs. So, for example, if you wanted to find Tobias\u2019s monthly allowance, you would have to know how much the shoes cost. So, let\u2019s say that the shoes cost $95, then Tobias needed to save up money for 3 times $95= $285. We want to solve for the number of days it"}

It demonstrates that good ideas are not created by fads or fleeting trends. However the problem with this statement is that it says nothing about the rest of the information in the article about the number of products that were created, the size of their income stream or the average income of every new product. The article provides very few statistics.\nThe best solution for the problem of the article is to create a table, which contains each new idea and their corresponding revenue, and then graphically represent the data, which shows the highest revenue producing products relative to the number of ideas and products created. The graph can also show the average revenue of each product relative to the number of products and ideas created.

She left the remaining money in her wallet. Her dog got ahold of her wallet and shredded all the money inside but $1. How much money did Leah earn working odd jobs around the neighborhood? \\nAnswer: You can assume Leah earned a few dollars more in working odd jobs than she spent and you can also assume the dog didn\u2019t get into her savings.

So, even if the dog got into her account and completely wiped it out, she still earned at least $11.50. And now, given that she took half of it down to $5.75 after the dog got involved, the remaining $1.25 means she earned almost half of what she earned since the $2.14 is half of $5.75, and the dog ate the other half of her earnings as well.

{"ground truth": 19.0, "prediction": "Question: Shawna's workout goal is 30 situps. On Monday, Shawna was only able to do 12 situps, so she decided that she would make up for the rest on Tuesday. However, she was only able to do 19 situps on Tuesday. How many situps was she able to do on Tuesday? \\nAnswer: 24. When someone is doing a training program (such as a daily workout schedule), a workout goal refers to either a prescribed number of repetitions or a target time period. In this case, workouts are represented as 12 and 19 in order to keep a 30-repetition goal. To apply the concept of goal-seeking in this problem, it is important to see through the concept that the value, k, of the linear function f(x) = 12 + k, where the value of the constant k is between 12 and 24, is the goal. As for the interval domain, it must be limited to the domain of natural numbers x: {1,2, ... .,24} to satisfy the assumption in the problem. In this problem, k, as a constant constant, is the input value for the program and x, as the number of situps accomplished, is the output value. Therefore, since f(x) = y, the goal-seeking problem 30 is to find a suitable constant k_ in the interval domain so that y, the number of situps achieved by Shawna, is equal to 3"}

{"ground truth": 75.0, "prediction": "Question: George bought some food for his trip: a bottle of juice, a sandwich, and a bottle of milk. The sandwich was for $4, and the juice was two times more expensive. The bottle of milk cost was 75% of the total cost of the sandwich and juice. What percentage of the total cost of the sandwich and juice was the cost of the bottle of milk? \\nAnswer: If the cost of the sandwich is $4, it means that the price of the food is $24. We can notice that $24/$4=6, so 6 is the cost of one sandwich. However, how can we make $4 by using $6? It means that we can\u2019t use $6 for two sandwiches. It is because $6 is more expensive than $4. The sandwiches could not have the same price as $6. If the $4 sandwich and one $6 sandwich cost of one bottle of juice, then it is 4+6=$10. If the bottle of milk has a cost of $10, then it means that it has a cost of 4/10=1/2, and if we took 2, then it would have 2/10=50%, then we can notice that we got 75% of 24 and the answer is 3 because 3 is 2/3.

{"ground truth": 300.0, "prediction": "Question: James joins a football team and becomes the star. He scores 4 touchdowns per game and each touchdown is worth 6 points. There are 15 games in the season. He also manages to score 2 point conversions 6 times during the season. The old record was 300 points during the season. What was the highest number of points during the season? \\nAnswer: 32\\nThere are 4 games in which he did not score any points as well as 4 games in which he scored 2 point conversions. That means he scored a total of 24 points. Another way of saying this is that he scored 1 point per game. Since he scored 14 games in which he scored 2 points, the highest he could have scored a total of 18 points. The final tally from the 2 points came in to 86% of the highest possible points. The other 80 points came from the 1 point per game. That 80% was another of the 9 possible numbers for 48 points. The other 80 of the 240 came from the times he scored no points (that was all 15 games). That totals 240. From this we can conclude, that the only way these 9 possible points during the season can be met is if we take a total of 46 or 48. This leaves one final possibility. With 46 possible the only other number that can be totalled if at 46 or 48 is 26. 26 points"}

What is the size of the portrait she sells for $5? \\nAnswer: \\nWe want to find the amount sold. If we take the 16-inch portrait amount sold as $10, we know that the smallest portrait that sells for $5 is at most 8-inches. \\n\nWhat about a 5-inch and 4-inch?

Adding three drops of a solution will turn the liquid in a beaker blue if there are copper ions present. How many beakers of liquid are there in the fume hood of the laboratory? \\nAnswer: \\n\\n\nFour and a half more than thrice the square of a beaker, and half of the square of a beaker.\nAnswer: 16,600.\nThe fume hood is square, so the number of sides is a square. Adding the square root to the answer does nothing, so the beakers can't all fit in the fume hood because some are too big.\nThere are 4 and a half units: three drops. Three cubed is the square of a beaker. Four and a half is half a beaker. Because the blue liquid in a beaker has three cubes more liquid than half a beaker, half a beaker plus 3 cubes is equal (because they make an equal shape): 6.5 times nine is more than thrice times 16, so we can fit that in the fume hood.\nThe square root of the number is how many of the sides, so 7.92 equals 78. 16 times 4.5 is half of all the sides.

What is the tuition fee for Bran? \\nAnswer: 30% of $90 is $27.\nStep-by-step explanation: We first add the amount of the scholarship (30% of 90 dollars) and the part-time job's payment (15 dollars) with the total amount due by Bran from his University (12 dollar). The total 12 dollar figure means that he only needs to pay $172 in total. The 15 dollar from his part time job means that he'll have to pay $12 in total. After subtracting the part-time job's payment from the total, he will be able to pay half of what is left. And since $12 is half of what is left, $24 is the tuition fee for the school.\nThere is only one way to find total if we knew what Bran's tuition fee was first.

Then we plug in different amounts for the apples into the equation. \\nOr we could make a table representing the relationship of the number of apples to the money, multiply, and add.\nThen we convert the decimals into a fractions. \\nTo add 5+11+16+23+28+8+45, we could use the distributive property of multiplication, use the equation of lines on lines (the LGM formula), or multiply by 6 and add. \\nWhich approach is better?\nThe LGM formula allows us to do many operations in one step. For example, take $270, 27% of which is $5.69, which is the amount of change you will get when you pay $38.71 for a book that costs $13.09. We can find this amount of change in a single step."}

Two miles into the journey, he turned around and drove back home to retrieve some farming tools he forgot to take earlier and drove down to the farm. How many gallons of gasoline did Bobby have for his trips with his truck? \\nAnswer: For the first 2 trips of 4 miles each, he needs 8 gallons of gasoline for his truck. Now, the second trip, he had gone down to the farm 6 miles away. This, in fact, meant that he had to drive back to the house and again drove to the supermarket (5 miles away).

How many cows does Terez have on his farm?\nThis question is a mathematical problem that requires the calculation of the total number of cows that Terez has on his farm. This can be done by taking into account that 50 percent of the cows are females and 50 percent of the females are pregnant.\nFirst, it is necessary to write down the mathematical equation to find the number of cows. The equation is:\n50%(Female) + 50% (Pregnant) = T\nThis method is then substituted into the equation to calculate the total number of cows:\n50%(Female) + 50% (Pregnant) = T = 339\nFrom this, it can be seen that Terez has 339 cows on his farm.\nHence, the answer to this question is 339."}

After the storm, the Skipper used his GPS device to determine the new location of the ship, and he discovered that he was only one-third of the way to his destination. How many hours did the Skipper travel due east on the first day of the journey? \\nAnswer: The Skipper had traveled for 40 hours, not 20. His engine ran at full power for the first 10 hours, as planned, and then he used his engines sparingly (with a power of only 30 minutes per hour) for the next 30 hours. In the 20 hours when the engines were not running (due to the wind storm that blew the ship backward), the total distance the ship traveled was only 200 miles (instead of 2000 miles). The first day of the journey covered a distance of 20000 sq.ft. The wind storm that blew the ship backward did only a trivial amount of damage (since this was a sturdy ship). The Skipper was extremely embarrassed by the way this entire voyage turned out, and that is why he was never heard from again in the world. (The Skipper is a fictional character; he is not real. These questions were written by a student of the author of these questions.)\nThe answer is 40.

She bought 6 pears, 4 Granny Smith apples, 2 pineapples, and a small basket of plums, which were all placed in a single paper bag. Unfortunately, the bag that the fruit had been placed in had developed a hole. Therefore, as Tanya walked home, half of the fruit fell out of the bag. When she later counted the fruit left in the bag, there were only 9 pieces remaining. How many pears did she buy? \\nAnswer: 6 \\nExplanation: Let us draw a figure. Now a question of geometry is this: What is the perimeter of a pear? Or, more precisely, to a quarter of a pear? Well, you would say the pear is \u03c0/4. A pear is not exactly a quarter of a pear, but Tanya was looking at the picture, so let us just say that a quarter of a pear is \u03c0/4 a quarter of a pear. Well, is it \u03c0/4 of the pear, or is it \u03c0\u03c0/4? Well, let us start with a pineapple. Remember when Tanya bought the pineapple, she purchased a small box of plums. So, let us first subtract the pineapple from the pineapple. Therefore, after it is taken out, let us now subtract the pear. Tanya subtracted the 4-dollar fruit box from the total.

How many square feet is the house? \\nAnswer: You were given a lot of information in the second sentence that wasn't mentioned in the other sentences. In my experience, it can be very helpful to go back and highlight or in some way note these critical changes. For instance, this sentence could be highlighted in different colors, or perhaps it could be written onto a post-it note card and affixed to your desk so that it is readily visible. Then, when you are reading the problem, you can note that the second sentence gives you some critical changes. In this case, it informs you that the two houses are next to each other, and that the smaller house is being expanded. These things are not stated in the other sentences. What's happening when someone includes information in a sentence that is not in others? Well, the inclusion of the information is likely an error. You can go back and ask yourself if the sentence should be there. Does the sentence make sense given the other sentences? Usually when someone writes an error like this, they make the mistake of thinking it is fine to include a sentence that does not make sense given the sentences they are trying to correct or they don't give the necessary space around the sentence.

The key is to notice that there are 4 and 9 boxes in the first row. The rule for that kind of question is to write down the value of the sum and then minus the second part of the numbers to sum up the first part.

{"ground truth": 4.0, "prediction": "Question: At a gym, the blue weights are 2 pounds each, and the green weights are 3 pounds each. Harry put 4 blue weights and 5 green weights onto a metal bar. The bar itself weighs 2 pounds. How many blue weights did Harry put onto the metal bar? \\nAnswer: At the gym, you can lift two-pound dumbbells. You could throw in three-pound dumbbells because they have more mass than the two-pound weights. Then, you can add a four-pound weight and a five-pound weight. Now we know that the total mass of all the weights and the bar is 23. However, we just found out that the total mass of all five two-pound weights is 10 pounds. Therefore, the dumbbell must be 12 pounds. Thus, we know the total weight is 24 pounds. What did Harry do? He took four of the two-pound weights and put them on the metal bar.

She knows that each dress takes 4 square meters of fabric and 3 hours to make. How many square meters of fabric does each dress take? \\nAnswer: There are three variables to be used here; fabric requirement, time requirement and number of dresses that we need to make. We need to solve this system of equations. Using the values we are given, we can find the values we need to set to equal out to the solution set. We already know that each fabric takes 4 square meters. If each fabric takes 4 square meters, then we need 12 square meters of fabric. Next we know that each dress takes 3 hours to make, which means that for each hour, we would need a full square meter of fabric. Therefore, we need to use 6 hours. Therefore, we will have Melissa need 6 hours of clay fabric time, and 6 hours of clay fabric requirement time. The system of equations is now ready to be solved. To do so, first let x represent the required amount of clay, then let y represent the required amount of hours. Our solution set will be found at the intersection of these two sets.

{"ground truth": 4.0, "prediction": "Question: There are 4 puppies and 3 dogs at a camp. Each dog eats twice as much food as a puppy, but each puppy eats three times as often as a dog. How many puppies are there at the camp? \\nAnswer: This problem can be solved in two ways. The \ufb01rst method involves the use of the following formula, where $A_1$, $A_2$ (both values are assumed to be the same) represents the total daily feed intake of all three puppies and the equation says that the total daily feed intake $A_1 + A_2 = A$ (the fourth unknown variable). The second formula is $\\frac{A}{1} = \\frac{A_1}{2},\\frac{A}{3} = \\frac{A_1}{6}$ which says the amount of food one puppy eats is twice the amount the three dogs eat which in turn is six times the amount the three dogs eat which in turn is a third of the amount the three dogs eat which in turn is a third of the amount the three dogs eat. A fourth of the amount the three dogs eat is one-sixth of the amount the three dogs eat. The second solution is obtained by multiplying the first formula by the equation $C_1A_1 = C_2A_1 = C_3A_1$ and the second by the fourth and third by the sixth.\nFlorin Mano"}

How many trips does he make to the store every month? \\nAnswer: There are several ways to do this, but I'll show you one using variables. This way will cover your bases for more complicated situations.Step 1: Randy's ProblemThe first step in figuring out how many trips Randy makes to the store is to state the question as a math problem. In order to find the answer to the question, first we need to decide what we want the answer to be. (This should be pretty obvious, but just in case, don't skip over this part.) For our question, \"How many trips does Randy make to the store every month?\", we don't need an answer. We want the answer to be the number of times Randy makes a trip to the store. So, what does Randy spend on each trip?Let's call this number \"T\". I'll define T as he spends 2 dollars every time he goes to the store. Since there are 4 trips each month, then there are 4 * T. And there's a month, and one trip each month. So 4 * T is how many trips each month.So, to do the problem, we're looking for 4 * T,"}

Her brother bought one-third as many paperback books as Sarah bought, and two times the number of hardback books that she bought. How many paperback books did Sarah buy at the bookstore? \\nAnswer: \\nFirst, I will list all the possibilities that can cause the answer below: Sarah bought 7 books, but there are 3 more possibilities that can cause 6 or 5 or 4 papers. (So, in a way, the correct answer can be: 7, 6, 5, or 4 books...)\\nThen, the only thing that can cause the correct answer to be 4 books is 4/5 (4/3)... so 4 times 5/3 is 4 times 5/4 is 2 times 5/4 is 2.5 times 5/4. (4 times that is 10, which you can see that 4 times 5/4 is 2.5 times 5/4 because in a question 1/4 is 2.5, but if 4/5 is 2.5/ then when that is 2 times 5/4 it will be 2.5 times 5/4.)\\nNow, if you add 4 times 5/4, it will be 20, so then take .5 times that, divide the two times the number of .5 times,"}

To simplify, this problem can be stated mathematically as x = t * 0.5 / 8. The dental office gives 2 toothbrushes to every patient who visits. Solution The dental office gives away toothbrushes to patients when they visit. To simplify, this problem can be stated mathematically as x = t * 0.5 / 8. Substituting zero for x and plugging the t values in, the dental office gives away 2 toothbrushes to every patient who visits: t = 0.5 8 = 0.625 This is not reasonable or logical because if someone is in the dental office for 8 hours, they would be seen a total of 6.25 times when the office gives away only 2 toothbrushes for every patient who visits.

{"ground truth": 25.0, "prediction": "Question: Johnny TV makes 25 percent more movies than L&J Productions each year. By what percentage does Johnny TV make more movies than L&J Productions each year? \\nAnswer: A little number theory\\nIn this question, L&J Productions produces fewer films than Johnny TV. To figure this percentage, we would need to know how many films each of them produced. However, we have no information regarding this quantity. What we do have is that Johnny TV produces more films than L&J. So, we should find the percentage of how much more Johnny TV produces, since the information we do have is in terms of less and more. If we multiply Johnny TV\u2019s films by 0.75, the answer will be a percentage.\nThe method to derive this percentage is to use:\nJohnny TV\u2019s total films = $25\\%$ of L&J\u2019s total films = $25\\%$ of total films \u2013 $75\\%$ of total films = $25\\%$ of total films \u2013 $75\\%$ of total films\n$\\begin{split} S_1 = 0.25 \\cdot L_1 \\\\[5e-9] S_2 = 0.25 \\cdot (1 - L_1) \\\\[5e-9] S_3 = 0.75 \\cdot L_1 + 0."}

{"ground truth": 3.0, "prediction": "Question: While preparing for a meeting, Bill fills Dixie cups with water from out of a water cooler. The water cooler initially contains 3 gallons of water, and each Dixie cup holds 6 ounces of water. If Bill fills one cup of water per each meeting chair, and there are 5 rows of meeting chairs with 10 chairs in each row, then how many ounces of water will be left in the cooler after all cups have been are filled? How many gallons of water does the water cooler initially contain? \\nAnswer: The total number of ounces of water available will be 0 (therefore 0 gallons), because by definition the sum of all number in a sequence will always be higher than than the last term of the sequence. As an added bonus, the sum of the numbers in the sequence will always be divisible by the number of terms in the sequence. Therefore, 0 (0=the sum of all numbers) can only have 0 (0=the divisor of the sum) digits to the left of the decimal point, and no other divisor (see proof below). It's that simple. If a=0, then a=0. The sum is always greater than zero. Because the sum=0, the last digit after the decimal point must also be 0. It doesn't get simpler than that. You may challenge the use of division to determine divisibility. The use of division here is a matter of convenience.

In the morning she reads 5 pages and in the evening she reads 10 pages. How many pages does she read in the morning? \\nAnswer: The data provided gives a pattern of two instances read_time and two instances time_of_read of two persons. Also there does not exist a common time_of_day or read_day. The sample space of the data is = (7,2) (5,8) (6,7) (2,5) (8,8) From this it is obvious that the time_of-read=2 will never come under the same person twice. Thus if 5th read_time is seen twice together they should be of 2 and 8 separately. If the read_timing is 2 together then it will be found under the read-timing 8 since the read_time comes under person 1. Thus the read timings and the read-timings are different. So the read timings will be different for each time-of-the-reading. From this it can be concluded that read-time of 2 and 8 occurs twice in this sample of data."}

There are six centerpieces, so if there is between 1 and 3 roses, the number cannot be 6. \\nSo, how many does the number 6 minus the number of roses used have? Six minus the number of roses used is 3. Since the least number roses used is 3, the greatest number of roses must be 7."}

{"ground truth": 8.0, "prediction": "Question: Barbara asked the butcher for 4 1/2 pound steaks that cost $15.00/pound. She also asked for a pound and half of chicken breasts that were $8.00 a pound. What is the price per pound of the chicken breasts? \\nAnswer: This problem is easily solved by setting up a linear equation and doing simple arithmetic on it. Here\u2019s how it\u2019s done: You know that the total price is $63.00 (4 1/2 pound steaks at $15.00 a pound and one half pound at $8.00 a pound). You also know that the pound and half pound are priced at $15.00 a pound each. So, let\u2019s put these values into our equation. The equation could be $4x plus $x = 63. Substitution of numbers gives $4(4) + 1(1) = 63. Divide 63 by 6. The answer is one half pound at $8.00 a pound. So, the total price of the pound and half pound is $5.00."}

Let X be a random variable representing the time Andy spends getting to school and let F be prob[X is less than 11 am]. If school begins at 8:00 AM, then X will be between 0 and 2 (if Andy is extremely late and didn\u2019t even make it to school). So X is in the interval 0 2. The probability of X not exceeding 11, when it must, is (2 11) / 2. In this case, since there are red lights along the route, the answer is most likely X 10.

They are paid $100 for each delivery made in a day. In a particular month, Oula made 96 deliveries while Tona made 3/4 times as many deliveries as Oula. How much are they paid for each delivery made in a day? \\nAnswer: They are paid $100 for each delivery made in a day.\\nLet\u2019s assume that the total amount each made is $100. And the number of trips each made in a day is 100/0.4 = 25.\\nSo, 96 = 25 * 4. For the number of days, we can multiply the amount by 100/7 = 14.

If he takes a look at Toms budget, he notices that 120 square feet is the space needed for each seat, 6000 square feet is needed altogether, and that Tom also needs double the 6000, so it will be 12000, and now he will divide 12000 by 5, and get 2400, so he will multiply 2400 by 2 to double it, and then he ends up with 48000, this is how much the land cost will be, and after that the construction cost will be also double, and will end up with 96000, the square foot price will then become 27777, which is Toms total budget."}

{"ground truth": 2.0, "prediction": "Question: Prudence was starting a cupcake business. She figured that each cupcake cost $0.75 to make. The first 2 dozen that she made burnt and she had to throw them out. The next 2 came out perfectly and she ended up eating 5 cupcakes right away. Later that day she made 2 more dozen cupcakes and decided to eat 4 more. How many dozens of cookies burnt and had to be thrown out? \\nAnswer: I think you're trying to describe exponential decay. If there was an initial amount of stuff, you'd make that decrement every period in time which is an inverse of the decay/growth rate per unit time (the exponential decay rate). The number of stuff she has in total is equal to the initial stuff, times the exponential decay rate, times the time. That total would keep changing. So we have a recursive equation: the initial amount=the time elapsed * the exponential decay rate. For instance, if the exponential decay was 1/9th of what was made in each period, and she made 12 dozen cupcakes in the first period, then the initial amount of thing would be (312 * 1/9). That's the number of cups you have when she starts. So she's making exactly one dozen each time, except for the first period where she can't use the exponential decay rate to determine how many dozen she made. \\nHow many dozen did she have? When she starts, she has 72 (312* * * * *) cups. Then each period she makes 1 dozen of cups and eats 4. By the"}

How many tulips did she sell on the first day?\nRecreating the first day's sales:\nAs the third day's sales is reduced to 10% of second day's sales, we can write it as:\nWe need to find \"S\" from the above equation:\nTulips bought on third day (10% of second day sales)\nTulips bought on second day\nTulips bought on first day\nNow, we can substitute the values of \"S\" and find the value of \"T\"\nT= 80+38+50 = $178\nSo, the number of tulips sold by Maria are 178."}

That means there must be 2 balls that are not red, blue, pink, or orange. The only other possible combination, leaving 3 balls, would have to include both blue and an unspecified color. The only unspecified color available is orange and/or pink, so the answer must be 42.\nThat is exactly the point of the question itself. A few minutes of thinking and you will arrive at the same conclusion. The reason the solution to the above question seems so far removed from the original question is because it is.\nThe answer is 40. The answer is 42 because, without any explanation, it's easier to process the logic, even tho you may not completely understand its"}

Let us see that each team is allowed to make five substitutions in one match. Let t be the total number of substitute players, that starts the game in the second half. Then we have the following equations:\nQuestion: In a soccer game, if you add all of the team fouls committed, you get a total of 44 fouls. If you subtracted 3.0 times the team fouls committed, you would get 12 fouls. How many fouls were committed by the other team? Answer: Let\u2019s consider this scenario. We have 24 players prepared for the game. The first half saw 11 players start the game. The second half, the team made twice as many substitutions. We know that the total number of fouls committed is 44. Then we have the following equation: t = + + + = = = = + + = + + + + + + + = + = = + + + = = + + = 6.0 + = = + = = + = = + = + + + + "}

She wants to give the same number of stickers to each of her 5 students. How many students does she want to give stickers to? \\nAnswer: Her problem is, to get the same number of stickers for each child (no stickers extra and no stickers less) you must use all stickers. It is not possible to give extra or less stickers to all children. Thus, to solve this problem you must find a division number, (d) of the total number of stickers (300), that will divide 5 (her number of children) exactly. There is only one number that will do and that number is 6. Therefore, she will give 6 x 26 (or 294, to be sure) stickers to each of her children. ( 1527 )"}

How many tablespoons of lemon juice does every lemon provide? \\nAnswer: 9 ...\nThis is a common test of problem solving skills. In particular test-makers are interested in seeing how well a person can use information they were not explicitly told. This task requires a person to use information in a context other than what it was given for.\nThe problem above shows another way in which problems that require estimation and reasoning are related. This problem requires the interpretation of the word \"provide,\" because that phrase is not the same as the phrase \"provide with.\" The word \"provide\" used in this context has the connotation of \"provide with a quantity enough for.\" It makes the task of estimating the quantity much easier than if the word \"give\" had been used instead.\nA good estimate of how to solve the problem given in the solution step above will tell you that you will need to take the quantity of tablespoons and divide it by the number of lemons.

{"ground truth": 60.0, "prediction": "Question: There are four lamps in Valerie's room. All of them are burnt out, so she needs to buy new light bulbs. She needs 3 small light bulbs and 1 large light bulb. She has $60 to spend. How much money does she have to spend? \\nAnswer: This is a very complex problem that uses the concept of fractions and simple division. If Valerie needs 3 small light bulbs, we know that the value of one light bulb is $2. Then, if she needs 3 small, we know she needs to spend at least $6. Also, if she needs 1 large light bulb, we know that one large light bulb is worth $6. So, we can conclude that her money to spend is $8 (one smaller for each small light bulb and one large). \\n\nExamine the problem. If three of the lighting fixtures are burnt out, the value of one lighting fixture is $2 (1/2 the value of the entire room with all four lamps). To get 3 of the smallest lighting fixture, we must spend at least $6. Also, to get 1 of the longest lighting fixture, we must spend about $6.

There were 50 footballs, 40 tennis balls, and the remaining donations were basketballs. How many footballs were there? \\nAnswer: First, note that the donations of basketballs can be classified as being either basketball hoops or basketballs. If a basketball is donated, it is either a basketball or it is part of a hoop. The question does not state that if a basketball is donated it is a HOOP or it is a BASKETBALL, so we need to assume that every basketball is a hoop and every basketball is a ball. We can see that there were 300 balls donated. 20% of these were hoops and 20% were baskets.\nSo what this tells us is that they had 5 hoops for every basket, because there were 300 total balls for 150 hoops and 150 baskets.

From Monday to Friday, Mary collected twice as many red marbles as Jenny and half the number of blue marbles collected by Anie, who collected 20 more red marbles than Mary and twice the number of blue marbles Jenny collected. How many more red marbles did Anie collect than Mary? \\nAnswer: The amount of marbles collected each day is a linear relationship between 2 parameters. This can be represented in the form of a linear equation. A linear equation can be written as in the form of Ax + B, where x represents the number of marbles collected during the week. In this situation, Jenny's total number of marbles can be calculated as Jenny's total number of marbles = 2Ax + (B \u2013 A), where A and B represent the coefficients of the two parameters. Then, Jenny's total number of red marbles each day can be calculated as, Jenny's total number of red marbles = 2Ax + (A \u2013 B). It can be noted from the result that, Jenny's total number of blue marbles = 2(A \u2013 B)x + (B \u2013 A). By comparing the results of blue marbles collected by Jenny and Mary, it can be seen that, Mary's total number of blue marbles = 2(A \u2013 B)x + (A \u2013 B).

But some yellow-jackets were attracted to their food, and so one-third of the students outside jumped up and ran inside to the cafeteria, while 3 of the students in the cafeteria went outside to see what all the fuss was about. How many students have lunch during period 5? \\nAnswer: \\nThe problem can be written as: 5*5*5*5*10*5*1*5 where five is the total number of students, 1 is the number of students who had lunch under the tables, and 5 is the number of students who did not have lunch under the tables.

{"ground truth": 90.0, "prediction": "Question: John has a donkey and an elephant. The elephant weighs 3 tons (a ton is 2000 pounds). The donkey weighs 90% less. How much less does the donkey weigh? \\nAnswer: This is a well known parable used to explain a mathematical principle called the Law of Averages. The Law of Averages, or the Law of Large Numbers, states that in a very large group of numbers, the average (mean) will tend closer towards the actual mean (average) of a set of numbers. If you add one more number to the large group of numbers, the average will tend closer towards the actual mean. For example, suppose you have 354 numbers in a list. The average would be around 43.5. If you add a 355th number, the average will tend closer towards the actual mean of 43. In this case, it would be closer to 43.3. \\n\\nWe can apply this to weights and a donkey in the following way. Let John own one donkey and one elephant. The donkey weighs 900 pounds. The elephant weighs 3 tons (2000 lbs). John's net weight is equal to 3 tons (1 ton). The 900 pound average for John and 3 tons net weight for John is a 1"}

In which case, it's three cups of coffee per time she goes.\nIs \"every time\" required? I.e., should you assume that she goes only twice a day? If so, you could interpret it as three times a day, by \"every time she goes to the coffee shop\".\nA similar question to check whether or not the word 'every' is required: https://www.khanacademy.org/math/geometry-algebra1-gr-10/solid-figures/a/lesson/area-and-patterns/v/area-and-pattern"}

After she gets her money, she sees 2 shirts that she likes which cost $10 each and buys them. She leaves the store with $30. How much will they buy her pants for? \\nAnswer: Let the value of the clothes she is selling be x. Then\nLet the value of the clothes she is selling be x. Then\nWe cannot determine the price of the clothes that Selina bought. This problem asks how much, but it does not tell us what the total cost was.\nWe do know, however, that her total purchase, minus what she bought is $10. We can say that 1 of the 2 shirts that she bought was $10, and 1 was $x. We can determine that x > 20.\nLet's say that x is 30, and x is 30 + 10. Then 30 + 10 + x is $30 + 10 + 30 + 10 = $90 + 45 = $135. That would be the amount they bought from Selina for.\nHere you go. Try not to be so proud of yourself.\nWow.

She can drive for 30 miles on one gallon of gas. How far can she drive on one gallon of gas? \\nAnswer: Let X = number of miles she can drive on one gallon of gas. 2 hours of her traveling at 60 mph equals 1 gallon of gas. 2 hours of traveling at 60 mph is equivalent to 1 gallon of gas. The same is also true of her traveling at 50 mph, so: 2 + 5 = 7 = 1 gallon of gas. Her traveling for 3 hours at 50 mph only equals 2.2 gallons of gas. Her total traveling time + gas used = 2.2 + 1 = 3 total gallons of gas used. Her total miles traveled = 3/7 = 4. The last number of 4 only applies to her traveling at 50 mph since she only used 2.2 gallons of gas at 50 mph.\nShe drove for 3 hours at 50 mph, but she still used 1 gallon total of gas. 3/7 equals 4 times.

He used circles, to represent how many scoops of ice cream he can consume in one sitting, and squares, to represent the number of brownies he has hidden beneath his bed.

How many stars does the United States flag have? \\nAnswer: \\nA. 187 stars. \\nB. 233 stars \\nC. 234 stars\nExplanation: \\n\n\\nOption A is completely wrong. The US flag is different, but the 50 stars don't come from half of 100. \\nC. Option C. is also very wrong. This seems to come from option A. 50 stars must come from half 100, not from 100. For example, if half 166 is equal to 83, 166 - 83 = 83. In the same way 50 is not equal to 26 (25) because there are not 3 less than half 100, but there are 3 (2.5) less than 1/2 (1/2 + 2 = 1).\n\\n1/2 = 13 x 4 = 52, so, 16 x 11 = 177.

Therefore there is only one case to consider: there is 100 books on Monday. On Wednesday, the books are returned and we lose 10% books (or 10 books) since there were more books on Wednesday (100 books are not returned on Wednesday).

{"ground truth": 200.0, "prediction": "Question: Rhonda, Sally, and Diane are members of their school's track team. The three of them run the 600-meter relay race together. Rhonda runs the first 200 meters of the race, Sally runs the second 200 meters of the race, and Diane runs the final 200 meters of the race. Rhonda can run 200 meters in 24 seconds. Sally takes two seconds longer to run the same distance, while Diane can run 200 meters three seconds faster than Rhonda. How much faster can Diane run 200 meters compared to Rhonda? \\nAnswer: 200-meter relay races almost always end with the last runner having a large disadvantage in terms of relative speed, simply because the last person has to run so much less total distance than everyone else. Therefore, the average speed of the first 199 meters of the 600 meter race is 24 times 1.1 plus one.11, times eight, plus 11, divided by 199. This works out to 8.39 miles per hour (13.51 kilometers per hour) for the first 200 meters of the race.

They have both eaten 9 slices already. How many slices does the small pizza have? \\nAnswer: B) There are 8 slices left.\\n\\n\\nSolution: This is basically a classic division problem. If your small has 8 and your large has 14 and they've already eaten 9, then you can't have 8/14 of anything! You need 14 minus 9 of 8.

A 15 ounce bottle of water costs $2. He has $10 with him. How much does a cubic foot of sand weigh? \\nAnswer: 3 ounces\nThat's 1/12 cubic feet.\nI used a conversion for cubic feet. 1 cubic foot=7 cubic inches=144 cubic inches. And 1 cubic inch=4 ounces. Now, if I were to calculate and use those numbers you'd get 6.59.\nYou have a bucket that holds 2 pounds of sand. 1/12 of a cubic foot has 2.602.\nNow take your cubes. Make 1 cubic foot for the width (4ft=52in) and the height (2ft=22in). That would be 3/4 of 1 cubic foot with a volume 12 inches (91.444).

So you must solve algebraically. Let x be the age of Garret, and y be the age of Shane 20 years ago. Let's say Shane was 20. Now, 20 - 2 = 18, so Shane was 18 20 years ago.

After walking 3 miles Mark has to turn around and go home because he forgot his lunch. How many miles did Mark walk before turning around and going home? \\nAnswer: 10 miles\\nThis problem asks you to consider the concept of rate and speed. In simple terms, rate is \u201chow far you go in a given amount of time.\" Speed is \u201chow fast you go during a given amount of time.\"\\nMark traveled 10 miles and Chris traveled only 3 miles. If you look at the equation \u201cDistance = Rate x Time\", you can see that Chris traveled for 3 hours and Mark traveled for only 10 minutes - not 3 hours like Chris.

DIV-CUP is a system of notation for counting numbers. For example, 6 DIV CUP = 666 (six hundred sixty-six).

This is the question that made more sense to me but if you do not wish to do it there is another way to answer this question.The total number of cookies baked by Kristy (60 cookies) is divided by 3, which represents the number of friends arriving at her house. In addition to what is already given, it should be noticed that 6 of the 30, which equates to 33 percent of all the cookies, have already been eaten and 3 of the friends arrive at the same time to take their collective 5 cookies.

However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much money do they earn at the car wash? \\nAnswer: (Option 2) $500\nThe cost of a car should be $1700 since 5 friends are purchasing the car. The cost can be shared evenly because the car wash earns $500 and would be taken out of the $15 (for 5 friends = $15) to split the cost evenly with the 5 friends.\nThe earnings in this scenario means that:\nA $500 is left to be divided into 5 equal groups\nEach group will get $500/5 = $100.\nThe answer will be $100\nHence, the correct option would be (Option 2) $500.\nHence, the answer would be (Option 2) $500.\nLetter of Apology for Cancelling an Event"}

Each person pays $50 for the ticket and $10 for their entr\u00e9e, and half the people also buy unlimited drink tickets for $30/person. Then the dinner theater is canceled due to COVID, and each person gets a 90% refund. How much does each person pay for the ticket? \\nAnswer: After you subtract the value of the refund, a person paid $41.50 for their ticket, an average of $8.30/ticket. A person can spend 1/58th of the value of the refund on food and drink, since Jenny and her friends went to the theater for about four hours. At $5/hour per person, this cost is 5/13ths of the cost of the ticket. The refund thus represents about 1/6th of the cost of the ticket and this is the same proportion as $50/58.\nThe value of Jenny's ticket minus the value of the refund is $42 * 50 \u00f7 90 = 135 * 5 \u00f7 90 = $11.3355.

How much is Nina's scholarship worth less than Kelly's amount? \\nAnswer: Since Nina and Kelly received different scholarships, their amounts must not be the same. Because she received a scholarship less than Kelly's, we can apply the same logic to Nina's scholarship as we did to Kelly's. That is, her scholarship amount is twice the money received by Wendy. For instance, if their amounts were $1200 and $600, respectively, then Nina's amount would be $4800. The easiest way to determine how much her scholarship is worth less than Kelly's amount is to subtract Kelly's amount from $4800. That is: $4800 $- $1600 = $6900 Thus, Nina's scholarship is worth $69000. Question: Nina has received a scholarship worth $8,000 less than Kelly's amount.

How many more tennis balls does Frodo have than Lily? \\nAnswer: Lily has 62 fewer tennis Balls than Frodo does. Note that Brian has more tennis balls than Lily, so if you subtract Brian's from Lily's, you can subtract the tennis balls. Since Lily's and Frodo's add up to be more than Brian's, then Frodo's has that extra amount.\nThe first step is to solve the 2nd equation with respect to the unknown, in this case L. This has 2 variables and 1 equation. The usual way to solve such a system is by using the Gaussian elimination method. The first step is to add the three equations (we do not need to add the 2nd equation to the 1st equation: a2n + 1 = n, the equation equation that Brian has 2n -1 = n. Then we subtract the 3rd equation with respect to the 1st equation to give: a2n + 3 -1 = n + 3 -1 = n.\nNote that the 3 variables cancel out to give the single variable L that gives the answer for the problem.

{"ground truth": 8.0, "prediction": "Question: Nate went out to do his daily exercises. In 8 seconds, he ran a distance equal to four times the length of a football field. He rested for a while, then ran 500 more meters. How many seconds did it take for him to run a distance equal to four times the length of a football field? \\nAnswer: \\n\\n\nTough question. Let's look at the problem first.\nFirst, since a \"foot\" is 1.61 meters long, Nate ran 5 \u00d7 1.61 meters in 8 seconds. So, the first eight seconds must be 5/(1.61) = 3 seconds. He rested for about a minute, and by the time he did those twenty minutes, so another minute and twelve seconds means he was running at 6 minutes and 13 seconds per minute.\n180 minutes = 233 \u00d7 17 \u00d7 7 minutes or 64480 seconds or 64480/60 hours or 1079.6 \u00d7 60 minutes \u00d7 60 seconds.\nThe extra thirty-five seconds might have contributed to muscle soreness, but since we're talking about three thousandths, I'll call it even.\nNate is in good shape."}

Sunday morning, she saw that the store was having a sale and she bought four times the number of magazines she did on Friday. Later that day she discovered that her dog had chewed up 4 of the magazines. How many magazines did Alexandra buy at the bookstore on Friday? \\nAnswer: \\nLet us say the number of magazines Alexandra bought on Friday is x. Let x be the number of magazines in total that she bought in the first 2 days to get a total of eight magazines. We also know that on the third day she went back and bought four times the number of magazines so that would be 8x. Then we can say that x4 = 24 so that gives us a simple quadratic equation that is x4 = 24. Divide both sides by 4 to get x2 = 6 to solve the quadratic equation for x. Now let us say that on the Sunday that she was buying the 4 over twice the number of magazines that she did on Friday. So the number of magazines that she bought on Sunday to get 4 is going to be twice as many, because she bought 4 times the number of magazines she did the previous day, so 8x = 12 . We know that she bought 12 on the Sunday because she bought 4 times the number she did on the Friday so that means that she bought 8x on the original Friday, which was 8x. Now x2"}

On one route the total distance is 1500 miles and the average speed is 75 MPH. On the second trip, the total distance is 750 but the average speed is 25 MPH. What is the total distance on the second trip? \\nAnswer: This is a very classic question, and is an example of an optimisation problem (i.e. finding the optimal choice among two or more alternatives). Notice that the total distance on the second trip is 750+25 and 750+75. The difference is 125, and if you had to choose between the two, it would make sense to take the shorter option because there is less time to be saved. That would make us believe that the second trip is less expensive, and this is how you do optimisation problems.

{"ground truth": 300.0, "prediction": "Question: Marta sells tomatoes in a grocery store. On Friday, a shipment of 1000 kg of tomatoes arrived at the store. On Saturday, Marta sold a total of 300 kg of tomatoes to customers. On Sunday, the store was closed, causing 200 kg of tomatoes to rot and to be thrown away. On Monday morning another shipment arrived, twice the size of the first one. How many kg of tomatoes did Marta sell to customers on Saturday? \\nAnswer: 400\nQuestion: \\nIs the question wrong?\nAnswer: I guess the correct answer is 300kg. She sold 300kgs on the Saturday and the rest was spoilt so they did not count it as sold. When another shipment of kgs arrived it was too late as they had not sold any of that lot so they started selling again so she had to go back to 1000.\nThere may be an alternative way of answering the question as follows: if Marta had sold the original 1000 kgs on Saturday as well as the 300kg then she would not have any left over because she has sold them now leaving only what was delivered on the Monday. So she has effectively sold the whole shipment of 1300 of the 1000 original on Monday so 300 of the original original on Monday."}

During that time, Chris got sick for one week and Cathy took her shifts. How many hours were Cathy and Chris supposed to work per week at the cake shop? \\nAnswer: C. 20 hours \\nAnswers and Explanations: Question: Cathy and Chris got summer jobs at the cake shop and were supposed to work 20 hours per week each for 2 months. Cathy got sick for one week and took her shifts. How many hours were Cathy and Chris supposed to work per week at the cake shop? Answer: B. 22.5 hours Explanation: After each week, if they worked fewer than their allotted 20 hours, the time difference was credited to them as a bonus to be used later. The extra time they spent was equivalent to 2 hours per week for 10 weeks. A negative amount was required to be paid to the employer for the bonus amount owed. The bonus amount was then used to pay Cathy for the week she was missed. Thus, the total work time the girls were supposed to work was computed to be 20 (hours) + 2 (hours) per week for 10 weeks (20 weeks) = 22.5 hours, and the total bonus amount was $22.5.\nQuestion: Cathy and Chris got"}

Therefore, 9 is the highest number of possible liters in two containers. \\nFor the number of 4, there would need be liters of milk in the 5 containers. So the number of possible liters must be 1 less number 5. So the number of possible liters is in two containers is 9 - 4 = 5. For the number of 2 liters of milk must be put into all six containers, and the number 4 must be put into two containers. So the number of possible liters is in two containers is: 9 - 6 = 3.

{"ground truth": 2.0, "prediction": "Question: Kyle goes to basketball practice every day for 2 hours. At practice he spends half of the time shooting and the rest of the time running and weight lifting. How many hours does Kyle go to basketball practice every day? \\nAnswer: Since Kyle spends half of the practice shooting, and the other half doing the other, it really does not matter which order he does them. It is possible to do the two in either order, although he might be tired from shooting after one practice, or from weight lifting after another. The total time it takes him to do the two exercises, however, is the same. So if he spends half his time shooting he will then spend the other half of his time weight lifting.

After she gets through the door she traverses the obstacle course again and makes it out faster without the backpack, in 5 minutes and 58 seconds. How many minutes did it take her to make it out faster without the backpack? \\nAnswer: 8 minutes and 83 seconds.\nI think we can take them word for word and say \u201c8 minutes without the 83 seconds\u201d.\nLet\u2019s take 83 (8 minutes plus 83 seconds) away from 15 (7 minutes and 23 seconds plus 73 seconds):\n83 - 15 = 68...which equals 68 minutes.\nYeah I think those numbers (without the word seconds) will work! If we were to remove the 7 minutes that Lara took to enter and leave the room, then it\u2019d be about 61 minutes.\nAnd so that\u2019s where those numbers are in relation to how long it takes her to make it through the obstacle course. The 23 seconds in which she goes through the door take her just a little before the 68 minutes mark...and the 83 seconds when she goes through it a second time (again) take her a little after that 68 minute mark. I hope that makes sense, haha.\nGood luck, if you got my question right! Here\u2019s mine:"}

{"ground truth": 240.0, "prediction": "Question: Lucy has been trying new recipes and wants to make sure she keeps the cupboard stocked with ingredients. She had a 500g bag of flour in the cupboard at the start of the week. She used 240g when she baked cookies on Tuesday, and accidentally spilled half of what was left when she was putting the flour away. How much flour did she use when she baked cookies on Tuesday? \\nAnswer: \\nFirst, you need to know the difference between grams and ounces. You measure flour by weight, NOT by volume. That means, to start, you calculate the weight of the amount of flour Lucy actually uses, not what she thinks is leftover. You get the weight of 240 g by simply weighing it on a scale. So from the 500 g of flour, Lucy uses 240 g when she bakes cookies Tuesday. Now, the spill doesn't really have anything to do with her measuring, but you can calculate a probability of her spillage. It's hard to know how much flour actually spills, or exactly how many g she spills. But you can estimate what fraction of the 240 g she uses, or the probability of her spilling. To do this, you need to know how the spilling of the flour is distribution-wise. Here, a \"normal\" is a distribution of a random variable having a density function f whose derivative is also the density function. That basically means, when you apply a normal distribution to a set of data, you are assuming there might be random noise in"}

Each wall needs one coat of primer and two coats of paint. How many feet wide is Martha's kitchen? \\nAnswer: There are 12 feet in Martha's four-sided kitchen. Each side needs to be painted. The only difference between Martha's kitchen and your dining room is the number of coats of paint. If you are painting two coats, Martha's paint may take less time than your painting.

That would be just two coats, while if you were doing it, 1 primer plus 1 paint plus 1 more paint would be 3! I hope that helps.

Jim has to get everyone out of the pool, clean, and refill it when it gets below 80% full. How much water evaporates when someone jumps in the pool? \\nAnswer: Water evaporates at a rate of \u03bc g per minute, where \u03bc is the evaporation coefficient. To determine the rate of water loss, multiply $\\sqrt\\frac 52$ times the evaporation coefficient times the rate of water use. The average swimmer can jump or get in or out of the pool at a rate of 2000 W per gallon used. The pool has a capacity of 1400 gallons. Therefore, the average swimmer will change the pool volume by $212.5 \\mu$. Since the average swimmer moves through the pool 6 times per minute, he will cause 1304.38 gal of water to evaporate.

How long is Pat's stick? \\nAnswer: \\nFirst, we should take care of the unstated part of the problem statement: Pat's stick is 30 inches long and only 20 inches of it is covered in dirt. It is reasonable to assume the covered length is the shortest. The problem statement tells us Sarahs stick is half as long as Pat's. That means her stick is twice as long as the covered length. We know the covered length is twice the shortest stick. What is Sarah's stick? Two feet longer than Sarah's stick is four feet longer than Pat's stick. We know Sarah's stick is twice as long as Pat's. So Pat's stick is half the length of Sarah's stick. Pat's stick is half the length of some stick.
