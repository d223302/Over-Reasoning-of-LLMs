So, if Marvin sold 35 candy bars, Tina sold 35 x 3 = 105 candy bars.\n\nThe total number of candy bars sold is 35 + 105 = 140 candy bars.\n\nSince the candy bars cost $2 each, the total amount of money earned from selling candy bars is 140 x $2 = $280.\n\nNow, we can use the fact that the total amount of money earned is equal to the number of candy bars sold multiplied by the cost of each candy bar. So, we can set up the equation:\n\n280 = 140 x $2\n\nSolving for $2, we get:\n\n$2 = 280 / 140\n\n$2 = 2\n\nSo, each candy bar costs $2."}

[/INST]  Let's start by identifying the number of blowfish in the aquarium. You said that 26 blowfish stay in their own tank, so that means there are 26 + x blowfish in the display tank, where x is the number of blowfish that swim into the display tank.\n\nSince there are an equal number of clownfish and blowfish, there are also 26 + x clownfish in the display tank.\n\nNow, a third of the clownfish (which is equal to a third of 26 + x) swim back into their own tank. This means that 26 + x - (26 + x)/3 = 26 + x - x/3 = 26 + 2x/3 swim back into their own tank.\n\nSo, the number of clownfish in the display tank decreases by 2x/3, and the number of blowfish in the display tank stays the same, which means that the number of blowfish in the display tank is now 26 + x - 2x/3.\n\nSince there are an equal number of clownfish and blow"}

Distance to farm and back = 6 miles + 2 miles + 6 miles = 14 miles\n\nTotal distance driven = 10 miles + 14 miles = 24 miles\n\nNow, let's assume that Bobby's truck gets an average fuel economy of 15 miles per gallon.\n\nGallons of gasoline used = Total distance driven / Miles per gallon\nGallons of gasoline used = 24 miles / 15 miles/gallon = 1.6 gallons\n\nSince Bobby had 12 gallons of gasoline, he had enough fuel for his trips. He had 12 gallons - 1.6 gallons = 10.4 gallons of gasoline left after his tri"}

The store owner adds 80% to the wholesale price to set the retail price, so the retail price is 180% of the wholesale price.\n\nLet's say the wholesale price of the pants is x. Then the retail price would be 180% of x, or 1.8x.\n\nWe know that the retail price of the pants is $36, so we can set up the equation:\n\n1.8x = 36\n\nTo solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 1.8:\n\nx = 36 / 1.8\n\nx = 20\n\nSo the wholesale price of the pants is $20.\n\nThe retail price of the pants is 180% of the wholesale price, or 1.8x = 36.\n\nThe retail price of the pants is $36."}

Therefore, the total number of children in the second generation is 8 x 8 = 64.\n\nHowever, we are told that two of Max's children have 5 children each. Therefore, the total number of children in the second generation is actually 64 + 5 + 5 = 74.\n\nSince each child in the second generation has the same number of children as Max, we can repeat the process by considering each of them as the \"new\" Max. Therefore, the total number of children in the third generation would be 74 x 8 = 592.\n\nContinuing this process, we get:\n\n4th generation: 592 x 8 = 4736\n5th generation: 4736 x 8 = 37848\n6th generation: 37848 x 8 = 3"}

So, if there are x free response problems, there are 2x multiple choice problems.\n\nThe total number of problems is 45, so we can set up the following equation:\n\nx + 2x + 7 = 45\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n3x + 7 = 45\n\nSubtracting 7 from both sides, we get:\n\n3x = 38\n\nDividing both sides by 3, we get:\n\nx = 12\n\nSo, there are 12 free response problems and 24 multiple choice problems (since there are twice as many multiple choice problems as free response problems).\n\nTo find the number of true/false problems, we can subtract the number of free response problems from the total number of problems:\n\n"}

{"ground truth": 40.0, "prediction": "[INST] Mario's salary increased by 40% to $4000 this year. Bob's salary from last year was equal to three times Mario's salary this year. By what percentage did Mario's salary increase this year? [/INST]  Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. Mario's salary this year is $4000, which is 40% higher than his salary last year.\n2. Bob's salary last year was equal to three times Mario's salary this year. So, Bob's salary last year was $4000 x 3 = $12,000.\n3. To find the percentage increase in Mario's salary, we need to find the difference between his salary this year and last year, and then divide that by his salary last year.\n4. The difference between Mario's salary this year and last year is $4000 - $12,000 = -$8,000.\n5. Since the difference is negative, it means that Mario's salary actually decreased by 8,000 / 12,000 = 66.67%.\n\nSo, Mario's salary increased by 66.67% this year."}

They are offering an 80% discount and manage to sell 90% of the items. They owed $15000 to their creditors. What is the percentage of discount they are offering? [/INST]  To find the percentage discount being offered, we need to find the amount of money the store is actually receiving for each item after the discount, and then compare it to the original retail price.\n\nThe discount being offered is 80%, which means that for each item, the store is receiving 20% of the original retail price.\n\nSo, for each item that normally retails for $50, the store is now receiving $10 (20% of $50).\n\nThe store has 2000 items, so the total amount of money the store is receiving for all 2000 items is:\n\n2000 items x $10 per item = $20,000\n\nThe store owed $15,000 to its creditors, so the discount being offered is:\n\n($20,000 - $15,000) / $15,000 = 33.33%\n\nTherefore, the percentage discount being offered is 33.33%."}

The loan has 0% interest if she pays the entire amount back in 5 years, which she decides to do. What is the interest rate on the loan if she pays the entire amount back in 5 years? [/INST]  If Sarah pays the entire amount back in 5 years, the interest rate on the loan is effectively 0%. This is because she is not paying any interest over the 5-year period, as the loan has a 0% interest rate if she pays it back within that timeframe.\n\nTo calculate the interest rate, we can use the formula:\n\nInterest Rate = (Loan Amount / Total Amount Paid) - 1\n\nIn this case, the loan amount is the amount Sarah borrowed to start her business, and the total amount paid is the loan amount plus any interest paid over the 5-year period. Since Sarah pays the entire amount back in 5 years, the total amount paid is equal to the loan amount. Therefore, the interest rate can be calculated as follows:\n\nInterest Rate = (Loan Amount / Loan Amount) - 1\nInterest Rate = 1 - 1\nInterest Rate = 0\n\nSo, the interest rate on the loan is 0% since Sarah pays the entire amount back in 5 years."}

We know that the ratio of goats to sheep is 5:7, so for every 5 goats, there are 7 sheep. Let's use \"G\" to represent the number of goats and \"S\" to represent the number of sheep. We can write an equation based on the ratio:\n\nG + 5S = (5/2)G + (7/2)S\n\nNow, we know that half of the goats are sold, so the number of goats after the sale is half of the total number of goats:\n\nG - G/2 = (5/2)G + (7/2)S\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n"}
{"ground truth": 10.0, "prediction": "[INST] The average score on last week's Spanish test was 90. Marco scored 10% less than the average test score and Margaret received 5 more points than Marco. What percentage less than the average test score did Marco score? [/INST]  Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. Average score on the test = 90\n2. Marco scored 10% less than the average score, so his score can be found by subtracting 10% of the average score from the average score:\n\n90 - (10% of 90) = 90 - 9 = 81\n\nSo, Marco scored 81 on the test.\n3. Margaret received 5 more points than Marco, so her score can be found by adding 5 to Marco's score:\n\n81 + 5 = 86\n\nSo, Margaret scored 86 on the test.\n\nTo find the percentage less than the average test score that Marco scored, we can use the following formula:\n\npercentage = (actual score - average score) / average score\n\nPlugging in the values we get:\n\npercentage = (81 - 90) / 90\npercentage = -0.1111 (or -11.11%)\n\nSo, Marco scored 11.11% less than the average test"}

How many players are there on the field in the match? [/INST]  There are 11 players on the field in the match.\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use the information that each player takes two bottles of water during the first break and one bottle at the end of the game. So, the total number of bottles taken by the players is 11 x 2 = 22 bottles during the first break, and 11 additional bottles at the end of the game, for a total of 22 + 11 = 33 bottles.\n\nSince there are four dozen water bottles in the box, and each dozen contains 12 bottles, we can deduce that there are 48 bottles in the box. Therefore, the number of players on the field can be found by dividing the total number of bottles taken by the number of bottles in the box: 33 bottles taken / 48 bottles in the box = 0.688... players.\n\nSince the number of players cannot be a fraction, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 7 players.

{"ground truth": 60.0, "prediction": "[INST] Opal won $100.00 betting on a horse race. She put half of her winnings into savings and bet the other half of her winnings. This time, she made a 60% profit and again, put half of her earnings into savings. What percentage profit did she make this time? [/INST]  Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. Opal won $100.00 betting on a horse race and put half of her winnings, which is $50.00, into savings.\n2. She bet the other half of her winnings, which is also $50.00, and made a 60% profit. This means she earned $50.00 x 60% = $30.00 in profit.\n3. She put half of her earnings, which is $30.00, into savings.\n4. Now, she has a total of $50.00 (original savings) + $30.00 (profit from second bet) = $80.00 in savings.\n5. The percentage profit she made this time is ($30.00 / $50.00) x 100% = 60%.\n\nSo, Opal made a 60% profit this time."}
{"ground truth": 60.0, "prediction": "[INST] Carol has $60 and saves $9 per week. Mike has $90 and saves $3 per week. How much money does Carol have? [/INST]  To find out how much money Carol has, we need to calculate how much she has saved in total.\n\nCarol saves $9 per week, so in one week, she has saved $9.\n\nIn two weeks, she has saved $9 + $9 = $18.\n\nIn three weeks, she has saved $18 + $9 = $27.\n\nIn four weeks, she has saved $27 + $9 = $36.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSince Carol has $60 to start with, and she saves $9 per week, after 7 weeks, she will have saved a total of:\n\n$60 + $9(7) = $60 + $63 = $123\n\nTherefore, Carol has a total of $123."}
{"ground truth": 12.0, "prediction": "[INST] There are three machines in a factory. Machine A can put caps on 12 bottles in 1 minute. Machine B can put caps to 2 fewer bottles than Machine A. Machine C can put caps to 5 more bottles than Machine B. How many bottles can Machine A put caps on in 1 minute? [/INST]  To solve this problem, we can start by using the information that Machine A can put caps on 12 bottles in 1 minute.\n\nWe know that Machine B can put caps on 2 fewer bottles than Machine A, so Machine B can put caps on 12 - 2 = 10 bottles in 1 minute.\n\nWe also know that Machine C can put caps on 5 more bottles than Machine B, so Machine C can put caps on 10 + 5 = 15 bottles in 1 minute.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is: Machine A can put caps on 12 bottles in 1 minute."}
{"ground truth": 3.0, "prediction": "[INST] John has a sneezing fit for 2 minutes. He sneezes once every 3 seconds. How often does he sneeze? [/INST]  To find out how often John sneezes, we can use the information that he sneezes once every 3 seconds.\n\nThere are 60 seconds in 1 minute. So, in 2 minutes, there are 2 x 60 = 120 seconds.\n\nSince John sneezes once every 3 seconds, he sneezes 120 / 3 = 40 times in 2 minutes.\n\nTherefore, John sneezes 40 times during his 2-minute sneezing fit."}

{"ground truth": 3.0, "prediction": "[INST] Jason is planning a parking garage that will have 12 floors. Every 3rd floor has a gate where drivers have to show ID, which takes two minutes. To get from one floor to the next, drivers have to drive 800 feet at 10 feet/second. On which floor is the gate where drivers have to show ID? [/INST]  The gate where drivers have to show ID is located every 3rd floor, so it will be on floors 3, 6, 9, and 12.\n\nTo find the floor where the gate is located, we can use the formula:\n\nFloor number = (Total number of floors / 3) + 1\n\nIn this case, the total number of floors is 12, so:\n\nFloor number = (12 / 3) + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5\n\nTherefore, the gate where drivers have to show ID is located on floor 5."}
{"ground truth": 50.0, "prediction": "[INST] On Black Friday a popular electronics store sells 327 televisions. This is 50 more than they sold last Black Friday. What is the difference between this and what they sold last Black Friday? [/INST]  The difference between the number of televisions sold this Black Friday and last Black Friday is 50.\n\nThis Black Friday, the store sold 327 televisions, while last Black Friday, they sold 277 televisions (327 - 277 = 50)."}
