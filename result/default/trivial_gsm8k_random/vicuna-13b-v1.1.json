{"ground truth": 30.0, "prediction": "Question: Last year Jessica paid $1000 for rent, $200 for food, and $100 for car insurance each month. This year her rent goes up by 30%, food costs increase by 50%, and the cost of her car insurance triples because she was at fault in an accident. By what percentage does her rent go up this year?

This year the rent increased by 1000 - 1000 \\* 1.3333 = 333.33, food increased by 200 - 200 \\* 1.5 = 100, and car insurance increased by 100 - 100 \\* 3 = 200.

Answer: \n\nIan won $\\$100 in the lottery. Let's call the amount he paid to Colin, Mark, and the amount he paid to Helen, John. Since Ian paid twice as much to Helen as he had paid to Colin, we can write:\n\nJohn = 2 \\* Mark\n\nSince the amount Ian paid to Benedict was half of the amount he paid to Helen, we can write:\n\nBenedict = Helen / 2\n\nCombining the previous two equations, we get:\n\nMark + John = 2 \\* Mark + Helen / 2\n\nSimplifying the right-hand side, we get:\n\n3 \\* Mark = 3 \\* Mark + Helen\n\nSince the amount of the debts is the same as the sum of the amounts paid to Colin, Mark, and Helen, we know that:\n\nMark + John + Benedict = 100\n\nSubstituting our expressions for Mark and John, we get:\n\n4 \\* Mark + 2 \\* Helen = 100\n\nSolving for Mark, we get:\n\nMark = 33.33\n\nTherefore, the original amount of the debts was $\\$33.33.", "n_output": -1}

{"ground truth": 1600.0, "prediction": "Question: Matt buys a massager. At the lowest setting, it vibrates at 1600 vibrations per second. At the highest setting, it vibrates 60% faster. Matt uses it for 5 minutes at the highest setting. How many vibrations per second does it vibrate at the lowest setting? Answer: 4000 vibrations per second\n\nThis is a simple proportion problem. The ratio of the two vibrations per second is 4000:1600 or 4:1. To find the lower setting, we divide the higher setting ratio by the same ratio of the two. 60% faster means it's 60/100 times as fast, which is 1.6 times as fast. So, the lower setting is 1/1.6 = 0.625 times as slow.

How many sixth-grade students were asked about the number of novels they read per month? Answer: 52\n\nExplanation: Since 3/4 of the students read two novels, we can find the number of students who read two novels by multiplying the total number of students by the fraction of students who read two novels, or 35/120. This simplifies to 1/4. Thus, the number of students who read two novels is 1/4 of the total number of students, or 1/4 \\* 240 = 57.5. Since we can only ask about the number of novels read per month and not about the fraction of students who read two novels, we have to round down to the nearest integer, which is 57. The number of students who did not read any novels is found by subtracting the number of students who read one or more novels from the total number of students, which is 35 + 5/12 + 2/3, which simplifies to 52/12. Checking our work, the number of students who read two novels is 57 and the number of students who did not read any novels is also 57, so our answer of 52 is correct.", "n_output": -1}

At the second stop, 17 people get on the bus and 10 get off. How many people boarded the bus at the first stop? Answer: 15. Explanation: The number of people on the bus is always 23x, where x is the number of rows. Therefore, 16+15+17=48, which is the sum of the people on the bus. Since the number of people on the bus is equal to the number of seats (23x), we can set up the equation 23x=48. Solving this equation gives us x=3, which means there are 3 rows of seats available on the bus. Therefore, the number of seats available on the bus is 23x3=69. However, since 15 people boarded the bus at the first stop, the number of seats left on the bus is 23x2=46. Therefore, the number of seats left on the bus after the first stop is 46. After the second stop, the number of seats left on the bus is 23x-2=44. Therefore, the number of seats left on the bus after the second stop is 44.", "n_output": -1}

{"ground truth": 1.0, "prediction": "Question: Natalie's sister had 8 small diaries in her locker. Last summer she bought double the number of diaries she had and then lost 1/4 of what she had. How many diaries did she lose last summer? Answer: 2. Explanation: Natalie had 8 small diaries and she bought 16 diaries, so she lost 2 diaries, because she lost 1/4 of what she had.\n\nRationale: The problem and solution involve multiplication and division of whole numbers. Natalie lost 1/4 of the diaries she had, which means she lost 2 diaries because 1/4 is equal to 25%, and 25% of 8 is equal to 2. Therefore, Natalie lost 2 diaries last summer.\n\n3. **Question: A library has 500** books. **in the fiction section**. Last year, the library bought 300 new books and received 150 new books as donations. How many books does the library have in the science and biography sections combined? Answer: 800. Explanation: To find the total number of books the library has in the science and biography sections combined, we need to add the number of books the library has in the fiction section to the number of books it received in donations in the non-fiction section. The library received 150 new books, so it has 300+150, or 450 books in the non-fiction section. The library had 500 books total in the fiction and non-fiction sections, so it has 500-450, or 50 books in the science and biography sections combined.\n\nRationale: The problem is a word problem that includes addition and subtraction of whole numbers. The library added 300 books to its collection from purchases and received 150 books as donations, bringing its collection in the non-fiction section to 450 books. The library library collection in the science and biography sections is 500 books in total. Therefore, the library received 150 books in\n\n\n4. **Question: Jake has $62,** and has to buy to buy new new crayons and markers for his class project.

{"ground truth": 20.0, "prediction": "Question: On the first day of the journey, the Skipper sailed his ship halfway to the destination by traveling due east for 20 hours at a speed of 30 kilometers per hour, and then turned the ship's engines off to let them cool down. But while the engines were off, a wind storm blew his vessel backward in a westward direction. After the storm, the Skipper used his GPS device to determine the new location of the ship, and he discovered that he was only one-third of the way to his destination. How many hours did the Skipper travel due east on the first day of the journey? Answer: 20.\n\nAnswer: The first part of the question mentions the Skipper sailing his ship halfway to the destination by traveling due east for 20 hours at a speed of 30 kilometers per hour. Then the question states that while the engines were off, a wind storm blew the ship backward in a westward direction. The question then asks for the new location of the ship, and given that information, it can be inferred that the ship traveled west for some amount of time.\nGiven the information provided, the total distance traveled by the ship is the sum of the distance traveled due east + the distance traveled west. Since the Skipper traveled halfway to the destination by traveling due east for 20 hours at a speed of 30 kilometers per hour, east, and the ship was blown backward by a wind storm in west, the distance traveled by the ship was not just the initial 20 hours due east, but also included the distance traveled backward west. Thus, the total distance traveled by the ship was 20 + X, where X is the distance traveled west. Since the question states that the Skipper discovered that he was one-third of the way to his destination after the wind storm, it can be inferred that the distance traveled west in the storm was equal to the difference between the total distant on the initial journey plan and the one-third of the way to the destination, which can be represented as 1/3 \\* total distance. Since the total distance traveled by the ship east + west was 20 + X, and the distance traveled west in the storm was 1/3 \\* total distance, it follows that X = 20 \\* 3 = 60 kilometers.

{"ground truth": 30.0, "prediction": "Question: Josh built his little brother a rectangular sandbox. The perimeter of the sandbox is 30 feet and the length is twice the width. What is the perimeter of the sandbox? Answer: 30 feet.\n\nAnswer: A) 6 feet\n\nExplanation: If the perimeter of the sandbox is 30 feet and the length is twice the width, then the width is 10 feet (30 feet / 2 = 15 feet / 2, which simplifies to half of 15 feet, or 10 feet). So the perimeter of the sandbox is 30 feet + 10 feet = 40 feet, which is not equal to 30 feet.\n\nIn terms of set theory, if we let W be the set of all widths of the sandbox and L be the set of all lengths of the sandbox that are twice the width, then the width and length are related by the equation W = L / 2. Therefore, the perimeter of the sandbox is P = 2 \\* (L + 10), because the perimeter is the sum of the two sides of the rectangle and the two end walls. Thus, P = 2 \\* (L / 2 + 10 + 10), because the perimeter is the sum of the two sides and the two end walls. Therefore, P is equal to 20*L + 20, which simplifies to P = 40*L.\n\nExample:\n\n* If L = 15 feet, then P = 45 feet (2 \\* (15 + 10) + 20)\n* If L = 20 feet, then P = 60 feet (2 \\* (20 + 10) + 20)\n* If L = 25 feet, then P = 75 feet (2 \\* (25 + 10) + 20)\nAnswer: A) 6 feet.", "n_output": -1}

Today we will be discussing an issue that affects many of us, Mental Health. It is an important topic that is often overlooked or not taken seriously. We will be discussing the importance of taking care of our mental health and how it affects our daily lives. I'm your host Siti Misson and I'm here to explore this with you today.\n\nThesis:\nMental health is just as important as physical health. It affects all aspects of our lives. It affects how we think, feel and act. It's important to take care of our mental health just like we do our physical health.\n\nReasons:\n\nFirst reason, our thoughts affect our emotions which in turn affect our actions. If we have negative thoughts, we will have negative emotions which can lead to negative actions. It's important to have positive thoughts which lead to positive emotions and actions.\n\nSecond reason, when we have poor mental health, it can affect our relationships with others. We might be irritable, short tempered or even lash out at others. Having good mental health allows us to maintain good relationships with others.\n\nThird reason, people with good mental health are more likely to take care of themselves physically. When we take care of our mental health, we are able to have a positive outlook on life and engage in activities that promote good health.\n\nBody:\nNow, let's dive deeper into this topic.\n\nFirst, let's talk about the common misconceptions surrounding mental health. Many people believe that mental health is only important when you have a diagnosed with a mental illness. This is not true. Mental health is important for everyone, whether you have a mental illness or not.\n\nNext, let's talk about the importance of self-care. Self-care is any activity that we do to take care of our physical and mental well-being. This includes things like getting enough sleep, exercise, and spending time with", "n_output": -1}

How many inches of rain fell on Monday morning? Answer: 2 inches.\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n\nLet's start by finding the total amount of rain that fell on Monday. Since Emily tells us that it rained 2 inches on Monday morning and 1 more inch later that day, the total amount of rain on Monday is 3 inches.\n\nNext, let's find the total amount of rain that fell on Tuesday. Since it rained twice as much on Tuesday as it did on Monday, the total amount of rain on Tuesday was 6 inches.\n\nSince it did not rain on Wednesday, the total amount of rain that fell on Wednesday is 0 inches.\n\nOn Thursday, it rained 1 inch. So the total amount of rain that fell on Thursday was 1 inch.\n\nFinally, the biggest storm was on Friday when the total amount of rain was equal to Monday through Thursday combined.

Since the remaining 10% wandered off into the hills, all of the sheep that were not rounded up, 10%, were included in the 90% that were rounded up. Therefore, 90% of Carla's sheep were rounded up by her sheepdog.\n\nStatement 1:\nLet R be the percentage of students who receive an A on the test.\nLet B be the percentage of students who receive a B on the test.\nR = 0.25 (given)\nB = 0.25 (given)\n\nThe students' grades are divided equally into three groups: A, B, and C.\nTherefore, the remaining 0.25 - 0.25 = 0.0 grades are not A, B, or C, which means they are either D or F.\n\nAnalysis:\n\nThere are two ways to construct the group C (from the students who got A or B), and each has a probability of 0.5. So, each construction has an equal probability of happening.\n\nConstructing A and B from the students who got A or B is considered constructing A and B from the students who got A or B, and this also has an equal probability of 0.5.\n\nNo matter which construction is selected, it is always true that at least one student gets an A or a B on the test.\n\nBy exa, there are two possibilities when constructing the group based on the students who got an A or a B A students. In one possibility, a all the students are A's. In the other possibility, a some students are A's and the others are B's. In both possibilities, at least one students student gets an A or a B on the test, so R and B are both both greater than or equal to 0.5. 5.\n\nSo by R and B both being at least 0.5. 5., it follows that R+B=1. 0.\n\nConclusion:\nTherefore, we have proven that R+B=1.", "n_output": -1}

What percentage of Luna's house rental budget is her monthly food budget? Answer: 100% - 60% = <<100%-60%=40%>>40%\nTo solve this problem, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Determine the budget for each item. We know that Luna's monthly food budget is 60% of her house rental budget, and her phone bill budget is 10% of her food budget.\n\nLet's call the budgets for each item x and y, respectively. Then we have:\nx = 0.6 \\* z\ny = 0.1 \\* x\n\nwhere z is the budget for Luna's house rental.\n2. Solve for y. We want to find out how much Luna spends on her phone bill, given that she spends 60% of her house rental budget on food. We can set up the equation:\n0.1 \\* x = y\n\nand solve for x:\nx = 1 / 0.1 = z\n\nSubstituting this expression for x into the first equation, we get:\n0.6 \\* z = y\n\nSolving for y, we find that Luna spends 10% of her food budget on her phone bill.\n3. Solve for x. We want to find out how much Luna spends on her house rental, given that she spends 40% of her house rental budget on food. We can set up the equation:\n0.4 \\* z = x\n\nand solve for x:\nx = 1 / 0.4 = 2.5 \\* z\n\nSubstituting this expression for x into the first equation, we get:\n0.6 \\* z = (2.5 \\* z)\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2.5, we obtain:\n1.5 \\* z = x\n\nMultiplying both sides by 0.6, we obtain:\n1 = z\n\nSubstituting this expression for z in any of the earlier equations, we can solve for any of the other variables.", "n_output": -1}

By how much is the fine increased for every mile per hour Mark was going over the speed limit? Answer: 1) $2.10 2) $2.20 3) $2.30 4) $2.15 \nSuggestion: $2.20\n\nSolution: This is a simple matter of arithmetic. The fine is increased by $2 for every mile per hour over the speed limit. If Mark was going 75 miles per hour in a 30 miles per hour zone, he was going 25 miles per hour over the speed limit. The base fine is $50, so the fine is increased by $2 \\* 25 = $<<2\\*25=50>>50. This means the total fine is $50 + $50 = $<<50+50=100>>100. The fine is also doubled because he was in a school zone, so the total fine is doubled too. This brings the total fine to $200. The judge also make him pay $300 in court costs and he have to pay his lawyer $80/hour for three hours of work.\nso the fine increased by $2.20.", "n_output": -1}

From a distance how much less could Velma's flashlight be seen at night compared to Freddie's flashlight? Answer: 200*3\n\nQuick answer: 600\n\nExplanation:\nLet's call the distance at which Freddie's flashlight can be seen as x.\n\nAccording to the problem statement, the distance at which Velma's flashlight can be seen is 2000 feet less than 5 times the distance at which Freddie's flashlight can be seen, which is 2000 - 5x.\n\nWe can use the following equation to find x:\nx + 2000 = 5x, so x = 4000/2 = 2000 feet.\n\nThus, the distance at which Freddie's flashlight can be seen is 2000 feet, and the distance at which Velma's flashlight can be seen is 2000 - 2000 = 0 feet.\n\nSince Velma's flashlight is not seen at night, it's not possible to compare the distance of visibility of her flashlight with Freddie's flashlight and we cannot determine the difference in visibility.", "n_output": -1}

How many kids are going to soccer camp in the afternoon? Answer: 750/4\n\nExplanation: We can start by using algebra to solve the problem. Let's say that x is the number of kids going to soccer camp in the afternoon. Then, we can use the information given in the problem to write two equations:\n\n1. x + (1/4)x = 750 (Equation 1)\n2. x = 750/4 (Equation 2)\n\nWe can now solve this system of equations to find the value of x. To do this, we can subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2 to eliminate the fraction:\n\nx - (1/4)x = 750 - 750/4\n0 = 750/4\n\nSolving for x, we find that x = 750/4 = 187.5\n\nSo, there are 187.5 kids going to soccer camp in the afternoon.", "n_output": -1}

Here's what I've attempted so far:\n```\n# Determine the cost of the returned bike (700)\nreturned_bike_cost = 700\n\n# Determine the cost of the bike he sells (80% of the cost of the bike he returns)\nbought_bike_cost = 700\nsold_bike_cost = (bought_bike_cost * 80) / 100\n\n# Determine the percentage increase in the cost of the bike he sells\npercentage_increase = (sold_bike_cost - returned_bike_cost) / returned_bike_cost * 100\n\nprint(\"The percentage increase in the cost of the bike he sells is :\", percentage_increase)\n```\nI expect the output to be 120% but the output is (80.414213562373125)-(700) / 700 \\* 100 = 49.998758620667557\n\nPlease let me know what I'm doing wrong and how to fix it.\n\nThank you\n\n```\n\nUpdate:\n```\nThe sold_bike_cost = (bought_bike_cost * 80) / 100. So bought_bike_cost is 700\n\nsold_bike_cost = 700 * 80 / 100 = 560\n\npercentage_increase = (sold_bike_cost - returned_bike_cost) / returned_bike_cost * 100\n\npercentage_increase = (560 - ", "n_output": -1}

How much does The Life Journey CD cost? Answer: \u200b\n\nThe Life Journey CD is $\u200b\n\nExplanation: \n\nWe are given a list of three albums, along with their respective prices. To find the price of The Life Journey CD, we need to find the difference between the total price of all the albums and the sum of the prices of A Day a Life and When You Rescind.\n\nThe total price of the three albums is $100 + $50 + $85 = $235.\nThe difference between $235 and the sum of the prices of A Day a Life and When You Rescind, $50 + $85, is $100 - $135, which equals to -$35.

The number of elephants is half the number of parrots and snakes added up, and there are 3 fewer zebras than elephants. How many parrots does the zoo have? Answer: 8 parrots.  \nExplanation:\nLet X be the number of parrots, then according to the problem, the number of snakes is 3x, the number of monkeys is 3x+2, the number of elephants is X/2, and the number of zebras is X-3.\nSince there are 3 elephants, the total number of snakes and monkeys should be at least 3x+3 and 3x+2 respectively, but it's not possible as the number of snakes is 3x and the number of monkeys is 3x+2, it means that the number of parrots should be 8, and all the other animals can't exist.\nTherefore, the answer is 8 parrots.", "n_output": -1}

{"ground truth": 2.0, "prediction": "Question: John writes 3 stories every week. Each short story is 50 pages. He also writes a novel that is 1200 pages each year. Each sheet of paper can hold 2 pages. How many pages can each sheet of paper hold? Answer: 2 pages. Explanation: 48 x 2 = 96 pages in a year. So a sheet of paper can hold 2 pages.\n\nMy answer: I agree with the answer and explanation provided by the previous answer. In John's case, each sheet of paper can hold 2 pages because he writes 3 stories every week and each story is 50 pages long. Additionally, he writes a novel that is 1200 pages each year. Since a sheet of paper can hold 2 pages, each sheet of paper can hold 2 pages/3 stories = <<2*3*50=180>>180 pages and 2 pages/1 novel = <<2\\*1*1200=2400>>2400 pages.

There were 40 red candies, 20 less than three times as many yellow candies as red candies, and half as many blue candies as yellow candies. How many red candies were there? Answer: 10 red candies.\n\nExplanation: There are 40 red candies in the pinata. To find out how many yellow candies there are, we need 3 red candies for every yellow candy. So, there are 3x40 = <<3\\*40=120>>120 yellow candies. We want 120 - 20 = <<120-20=100>>100 yellow candies, which means there are 100/3 = <<100/3=33.33>>33.33 yellow candies. But, since we need whole number of candies, the least number of yellow candies is 33 yellow candies. So, there are 33 yellow candies and 10 red candies.\n\nTo find out how many blue candies there are, we need 2 yellow candies for every blue candy. So, there are 2x14 yellow candies = <<2\\*14=28>>28 yellow candies. But, since we also need 20 less than three times the number of red candies, there can be at most 20 yellow candies, which means there can be at most 20/2 = <<20/2=10>>10 yellow candies. Since there must be at least 1 yellow candies for each blue candy, the least number of blue candies is 14 blue candies. So, there are 10 red candies, 33 yellow candies, and 14 blue candies.", "n_output": -1}

How many puppies are there at the camp? Answer: 4\nasked by [No replies so far] on March 17, 2022\nfrom Killeen, TX\nIf there are 4 puppies at the camp and each dog eats twice as much food as a puppy, then each dog eats 4*2 = <<4*2=8>>8 times as much food as a puppy.\nIf each puppy eats three times as often as a dog, then each puppy eats 3*1 = <<3*1=3>>3 times as much food as a dog.\nTherefore, the total amount of food eaten by all the puppies is 4*3 = <<4*3=12>>12 times as much as the total amount of food eaten by all the dogs.\nHowever, since each dog eats 8 times as much food as a puppy, then the total amount of food eaten by all the dogs is 8*4 = <<8*4=32>>32 times as much as the total amount of food eaten by all the puppies.\nThus, there must be 32/12 = <<32/12=2.5>>2.5 times as many dogs at the camp as puppies. But since there are only 4 puppies at the camp, there can only be a maximum of 2.5*4 = <<2.5*4=10>>10 dogs at the camp, which is not possible.\nSo there must be 4 puppies at the camp.

How many pickle slices can Sammy eat? Answer: 60.\n\nExplanation: Let x be the number of pickle slices that Tammy can eat. Then, according to the given information, x = 15(x), or 2x = 15x, which simplifies to 1.5x = 15x or x = 15. Therefore, Tammy can eat 15 pickle slices.\n\nRon eats 20% fewer pickles slices than Tammy, which means he eats x - 15 = (20% x 15)x + 15, or 0.2x(15x) + 15, or x = 60. Therefore, Ron can eat 60 pickle slices.\n\nSince Sammy can eat 15 pickle slices and Ron can eat 60 pickle slices, the difference between the two is 60 - 15 = 45 pickle slices.

Answer: 5 years\n\nExplanation:\n\nTo find out how many years from now Andy will be twice as old as Rahim is now, we need to find out how old Rahim will be in 5 years.\n\nWe can use the fact that Andy will be twice as old as Rahim is now to write an equation:\n\n2x = y\n\nwhere x is the number of years until Andy is twice as old as Rahim is now, and y is the number of years until Rahim is currently.\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = 2y/2\n\nx = y\n\nSo, in 5 years, Rahim will be 11 years old (2 times the current age of 6).\n\nThus, Andy will be twice as old as Rahim is now in 5 years from now.", "n_output": -1}

{"ground truth": 6.0, "prediction": "Question: On a farm, on average every 6 cows produce 108 liters of milk per week. In five weeks the cows produced 2160 liters of milk. How many cows on average produce 108 liters of milk per week on a farm? Answer: 2160 liters of milk/5 weeks = 432 liters of milk per week. Divide 432 liters of milk per week per 108 liters of milk per week = 4 cows\n\nBut the answer says it is not the correct answer. Can you please explain where in the above reasoning is the error? And what is the correct answer?\n\nAnswer:\nIf we are given the total amount of milk produced by a group of cows in a certain period of time and asked to determine how many cows of a certain kind produce 108 liters of milk per week on a farm, we can use the following formula to solve the problem:\n\nNumber of cows that produce 108 liters of milk per week = Total amount of milk produced / (108 liters/week / number of cows that produce 108 liters of milk per week)\n\nIn this problem, the total amount of milk produced is 2160 liters in 5 weeks. To find the number of cows that produce 108 liters of milk per week, we can plug in this value into the formula and solve for the number of cows:\n\n2160 liters / (108 liters/week / x)\n\nwhere x is the number of cows that produce 108 liters of milk per week.\n\nUsing cross-multiplication, we can solve for the number of cows as follows:\n\n2160 liters / (108 liters/week / 1 cow)\n\n2160 liters / 108 liters/week\n\n2160 liters / 108 litersweek\n\n2160 liters / 108liters/week\n2160 liters / 108liters/week\n2160 liters / 108 liters/week\n2160 liters / 108 liters/week\n2160/108\n\nWhich gives us:\n\n2.375\n\nTherefore, the number of cows that produce 108 liters of milk per week on a farm is approximate to 2.375.", "n_output": -1}

How many gummy bears does the gummy bear factory manufacture in a minute?

To find the number of gummy bears, we need to divide the number of gummy bears in a minute by the number of gummy bears in a packet. We are given that there are 50 gummy bears per packet, so we can use that information to find the number of gummy bears in a minute. We can set up the equation 300 gummy bears/minute = 50 gummy bears/packet x 15,000 gummy bears/minute and solve for gummy bears/packet to find the number of gummy bears in a packet, then we can divide that by 50 to find the number of gummy bears in a minute.", "n_output": -1}

Answer: 90\n\nExplanation: To find Sandi's total spending, we need to find the amount of money that Gillian spent and subtract it from Sandi's starting balance. We know that Gillian spent $150 more than three times Sandi's total, so we can set up the equation 3S - 150 = G, where S represents Sandi's starting balance and G represents Gillian's total spending. We can solve this equation as follows:\n\n3S - 150 = G\nS - 150 = G-3S\nS - 150 = G-3(S+50)\nS - 150 = G-3(S+50)\nS - 150 = G-3S-50*3\nS - 150 = G-3S-150\nS = G-150-3*3\nS = G-150-120\nS = 30\n\nSince Gillian spent 150 more than three times Sandi's total, we know that Sandi's total spending was 150. Substituting this value back into the equation above, we can find that Sandi had a starting balance of 30. Answer: \\boxed{90}.", "n_output": -1}
{"ground truth": 300.0, "prediction": "Question: Troy had 300 straws. He fed 3/5 of the straws to the adult pigs and an equal number of straws to the piglets. How many straws did Troy have? Answer: 300 \\* 5 / 3 = 300 \\* 166 / 100 = 300 \\* 1.66 = 499 straws.\n\nRationale: To find the total number of straws Troy had, we first need to find the number of straws he fed to the adult pigs. Since each piglet gets an equal number of straws as the adult pigs, we can multiply the number of straws Troy fed to the adult pigs by the number of piglets, which is 3/5 of the total number of pigs. Therefore, we have 300 \\* (3/5) = 300 \\* 1.66 = 499 straws.\n\nQuestion: Troy gave 7/20 of the pumpkins to the piglets. How many pumpkins did Troy give to the piglets? Answer: 7 / 20 = 3 1/2.\n\nRationale: To find the number of pumpkins Troy gave to the piglets, we need to multiply 7/20 by the number of piglets, which is all of the pumpkins. Therefore, Troy gave 3 1/2 pumpkins to the piglets.", "n_output": -1}

What was the sum of Djibo's age and his sister's age five years ago? Answer: 35.\n\nIntroduction to solving the problem:\n\nIn this problem, we are given that five years ago, Djibo added his age with his sister's age and the sum was 35. Using algebraic notation, we can represent this information as follows:\n\nLet x represent Djibo's age five years ago.\nThen the equation becomes:\nx + (sister's age) = 35\n\nWe need to find the value of x and the sister's age five years ago that satisfies this equation. To solve this problem, we can use algebra to isolate the variable x and find the value of x.\n\nSolving the equation:\n\nFirst, we need to find the sister's age five years ago by substituting the equation into the additional information that is given in the problem.\n\nLet y represent the sister's age five years ago.\nThen the equation becomes:\ny = 35 - x\n\nwe can substitute this back into the equation to solve for x\n\nx + y = 35\n\nx + (35 - x) = 35\n\n2x = 35\n\nx = 35 / 2\n\nx = 17.5\n\nWe have x = 17.5, which means that five years ago Djibo was 17.5 years old, and his sister's age was 35 - 17.5 = 17.5 years old.\n\nSo the sum of Djibo's age and his sister's age five years ago ago was 17.5 + 17.5 = 35.\n\nCheck:\n\nFor check, let's substitute the values we found for x and y back into the original equation and see if it holds true:\n\nx + (sister's age) = 35\n\n(17.5) + (17.5) = 35\n\n35 = 35\n\nTrue.\n\n\nConclusion:\n\nProblem Solved.\nDjibo was 17.5 years old, and his sister's age was 17.5 years old five years ago. The sum of Djibo's age and his sister's age five years ago was 35.", "n_output": -1}

{"ground truth": 3.0, "prediction": "Question: During a race transmitted on television, five advertisements were shown, lasting 3 minutes each. One minute of advertising costs $4000. How long did each advertisement last during the race transmitted on television? Answer: 14 minutes. Explanation: Let\u2019s assume that there were 5 ads x 3 minutes each = 15 minutes of advertising time. Since one minute of advertising costs $4000, the cost of advertising during the race was 15 minutes x $4000 per minute = $<<15*4000=60000>>60,000. Therefore, the length of the advertisement has to be 60,000/14 minutes/per advertisement. Solving for the length of each advertisement, we get 60,000/14 = 42857.14, which we can round down to 42857 minutes. Dividing the length of the advertisements by the length of the race (14 minutes) yields 42857/14 = 3067, which we can round up to 3070 advertisements. The length of each advertisement is approximately 3070 minutes or 51.43 hours.", "n_output": -1}

{"ground truth": 3.0, "prediction": "Question: Susan had a bouquet of 3 dozen roses. She gave half to her daughter, and then placed the rest in a vase. The next day, one-third of the flowers in the vase were wilted. How many dozen roses did Susan have in her bouquet? Answer: 36\n\nExplanation: Let x be the number of roses in the original bouquet. Then, the number of roses in the half-bouquet given to the daughter is half of x, or (x/2) roses. The number of roses in the vase is (x-3) roses. Therefore, the number of wilted roses is one third of (x-3), which is equal to (x-3)/3. The equation that satisfies the given conditions can be represented as:\n\nx = 3 (the number of roses in the original bouquet)\n(x/2) = 3/2 (the number of roses in the half-bouquet given to the daughter)\n(x-3) = 3 (the number of roses in the vase)\nx/3 = (x-3)/3 (the number of wilted roses)\n\nSolving this system of equations, we find that x = 36, which is the original number of roses in Susan's bouquet.\n\nQuestion: If a car travels 60 miles in 2 hours at a speed, how fast does it travel?

{"ground truth": 30.0, "prediction": "Question: A certain kind of wild mushroom has either spots or gills, but never both. Gilled mushrooms are rare, with only one growing for every nine spotted mushrooms that grow. A fallen log had 30 mushrooms growing on its side. How many mushrooms were growing on the side of the fallen log? Answer: 27 spotted mushrooms and 2 gilled mushrooms. Explanation: We can use the fact that gilled mushrooms are rare and that there are 30 mushrooms growing on the fallen log to determine how many of the mushrooms are gilled. Since there is one gilled mushroom for every nine spotted mushrooms, we can find the number of spotted mushrooms by dividing the number of mushrooms on the log by nine and then dividing that number by the number of gilled mushrooms. This gives us 30/9 = 3 remaining mushrooms that are gilled. Since each mushroom either has spots or gills but not both, we know that the two remaining gilled mushrooms cannot be on the same mushroom. Therefore, there are a total of 30 - 4 = 27 spotted mushrooms and 2 gilled mushrooms on the fallen log.\n\nLATERAL LOGIC PROBLEM\n\nA train has 12 cars, numbered from 1 to 12, with the following properties:\n\n* Cars numbered 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 have the word \"GREEN\" on one side\n* Cars numbered 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 have the word \"BLUE\" on one side\n\nA person pushes one of the buttons and the doors to the cars close.

By the time she was twice that age, she was reading books 5 times longer, and 8 years later, she was reading books 3 times longer than that. Presently, she reads books that are 4 times the previous length. What is the multiplication factor for the length of the books she reads presently compared to the previous length? Answer: 3.\n\nExplanation:\n\nLet the current length of the book be \\*c* and the previous length be \\*p*. We are interested in the multiplication factor between \\*c* and \\*p\\*, i.e., the factor by which \\*c* is greater than \\*p*.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we have:\n\n* At age 6, Mandy was reading books with 8 pages.\n* At age 12 (twice age 6), Mandy was reading books with 40 pages (5 times longer).\n* At age 24 (8 years after age 12), Mandy was reading books with 320 pages (3 times longer).\n* Presently, Mandy reads books with 1152 pages (13 times longer).\n\nWe want to find the factor by which the present length is longer than the previous length. That is, the factor by which 1152 is greater than 320, which is the factor by which 24 is greater than 12.\n\nThus, we have the following equations:\n\n24 = 12 \u00d7 (1 + 5)\n1152 = 320 \u00d7 (1 + 3)\n\nSolving for the unknown values:\n\n24 = 24 \u00d7 (1 + 5)\n= 24 \u00d7 6\n= 144\n1152 = 320 \u00d7 (1 + 3)\n= 320 \u00d7 3\n= 960\n\nThus, the multiplication factor for the length of the books Mandy reads presently compared to the previous length is 3.\n\nTherefore, the length of the books Mandy reads presently is 3 times the previous length, or 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 pages.\n\nAnswer: \\*c* = 24 pages.", "n_output": -1}

Then twice a month he needs to use $200 of chemicals. How much does it cost each time? Answer: 3/3/2023 \u00b7 Each time John gets his pool cleaned, he pays $150, and this includes the cost of the cleaning and the tip for the person who comes to clean the pool. This means that the actual cost of the cleaning is $150, and the tip is 10% of this amount, which is $15. So, each time John gets his pool cleaned, he pays a total of $150 + $15 = $<<150+15=165>>165. Twice a month, John also needs to use $200 of chemicals.

{"ground truth": 16.0, "prediction": "Question: Mrs. Anderson bought 2 bags of 3-pound bag of cat food and another 2 bags of dog food that each weigh 2 more pounds than each bag of cat food. There are 16 ounces in each pound. How many ounces are there in each pound? Answer: 16. 16 ounces in each pound. So if a bag of cat food weighs 3 pounds, how many ounces is that? It is 3 pounds x 16 ounces/pound = <<3*16=48>>48 ounces. So if she bought 2 bags of cat food, she bought 2*48=<<2*48=96>>96 ounces of cat food. To find out how much each bag of dog food weighs, we can subtract the weight of the cat food from the total weight of both types of food. So the total weight of both types of food is 96 ounces + 2*x ounces = <<96+2*x=x2>>x2 ounces, where x is the weight in ounces of one bag of dog food. So the weight of each bag of dog food is x ounces - 2*x ounces = <<x-2*x=0>>0 ounces. Answer: \\boxed{0}.", "n_output": -1}

The second apartment costs $900 per month and will cost an additional $200 per month in utilities. The first apartment is slightly further from the man's work, and the man would have to drive 31 miles per day to get to work.

He also realizes construction will cost twice as much as the land. He has a partner who covers 40% of the cost. How much does it cost per square foot of space that he needs? Answer: 500 seats \\* 12 square feet per seat = 6000 square feet of space needed. 6000 / 4 = 1500.\n\nProblem Type:\nMathematical\n\nLevel:\nIntermediate\n\nTopic:\nAlgebra and Functions\n\nSolution:\nTo find out how much it costs per square foot, you need to find the cost of the theater. The theater cost is equal to the cost of the space times the cost of the space per square foot plus the cost of the space divided by the number of seats.\nThe cost of the space per square foot is 5$.\nThe cost of the the space is equal to the cost of the space per square foot times the number of square feet per seat, which is 12$.\nThe number of seats is 500$.\nThus the cost of the the space is 500 seats \\* 12$/seat = $6000$.\nThe partner covers 40% of the cost. This can be written as 40% = 0.40.\nThus the cost of the the theater is $6000 \\* 0.40 = $2400.\nThus the cost of the the space is $2400 / 4 = $600 per square foot.

On his second turn, he hit the ball again straight toward the hole and it traveled half as far as it did on his first turn, but the ball landed 20 yards beyond the hole. On his third swing, he hit the ball onto the green and it rolled into the hole. How far did the golf ball travel straight toward the hole? Answer: 180 yards. Explanation: The total distance the golf ball traveled, including the roll into the hole, was 180 yards (180 yd), but only the straight path toward the hole (not including the roll) was half of 180 yards, or 90 yards (90 yd). Therefore, half of the total distance was 90 yards (half of 180 yards), and the other half was 90 yards (the distance from the 2nd swing to the hole).

{"ground truth": 7.0, "prediction": "Question: Austin is a surfer. He took a trip to the beach during surfing season and the highest wave he caught was two feet higher than four times his height. The shortest wave he caught was four feet higher than his height. The shortest wave was three feet higher than his 7-foot surfboard is long. How long is his surfboard? Answer: 7 feet. To solve this puzzle, we can set up the equation 2(x) + 4(x) = 8x, where x is the height of the tallest wave caught. This equation becomes 2x + 4x = 8x, or 6x = 12x, which simplifies to x = 2x, or x = 1.5x. This suggests that x is either 2 feet or 3 feet. Since the shortest wave is three feet higher than the surfboard is long, the shortest wave is 3 feet, which means that the tallest wave is 2 feet, since the difference between the two is 2 - 3 = 1, which is equal to 0.5 times 3, or 1.5 feet. Using the information that the wave is 2 feet higher than the surfboard is long, we can establish that the surfboard is 2 feet long. By summing the wave heights from the shortest to the tallest, we deduce that the total wave height is 3 + 2 = 5 feet, which is equal to the surfboard length. Thus, the surfboard is 7 feet long.", "n_output": -1}

Since they had to spend a total of $12.00 on the perfume and they each earned $5.00 from their respective jobs, they each effectively only had to pay $12.00 - $5.00 = $7.00 out of their own money for the perfume.\n\nSo, the cost of the perfume that Christian and Sue wanted to get for their mom was $50.00. Since they each effectively only had to pay $7.00 out of their own money, they each ended up paying $7.00 / 2 = $3.50 each for the perfume.\n\nSince Christian and Sue both contributed towards the purchase of the perfume, they each paid 3.50 / 2 = $1.75 towards the perfume.

In the cube, points P1, P2, P3, P4, and P5 represent the middle points of the six sides of the cube. All of these points are equidistant from the center of the cube.\nThe line segment connecting P2 and P5 is parallel to the line segment connecting P1 and P4. The line segment connecting P3 and P4 is perpendicular to the line segment P1 and P5. Find the length of line segment connecting P2 and P3.\n\nSolution: To find the length of the line segment connecting P2 and P3, we can use the distance formula for the cube. Let's say the length of the line segment is (x) , distance between p2 and p3 is (x+y) , now we know that distance between p1 and p3 is 'a' and distance between p2 and p5 is (y) line segment p1 and p4 is of length 'b' now we can say that length of the line segment p2 and p3 is equal to square root of x^2 + (x+y)^2 + (y)^2 .\nso we can say that x^2 + (x+y)^2 + (y)^2 = a^2 + b^2 +(x+y)^2\n\nSolving equation we get x+y=2a+b\n\nx^2 + (x+y)^2 + (y)^2 =4a^2 + 2(a+b)y + y^2\n\nx^2 + 2a(a+b) + 2b^2 = 4a^2 + 2(a+b)y + y^2\n\nx=2ab - a^2 -b^2\n\nso the required length of line segment is 2ab - a^2 -b^2\n\nConclusion: last line segment connecting p2 and p3 is of length 2ab -a^2 -b^2 where a is distance between p1 and p3 and b is distance between p2 and p5.\n\nThere", "n_output": -1}

{"ground truth": 160.0, "prediction": "Question: Kristy, a sales representative earns a basic salary of $7.50 per hour plus a 16% commission on everything she sells. This month, she worked for 160 hours and sold $25000 worth of items. Her monthly budget for food, clothing, rent, transportation, bills and savings is 95% of her total monthly earnings and the rest will be put towards insurance. How many hours did she work this month? Answer: 160 hours. Explanation: Since she earns a basic salary of $7.50 per hour and she also earns a commission of 16% on everything she sells, this means that for every hour she works, she earns $7.50 as her basic salary and an additional $7.80 as commission on everything she sells, for a total of $15.30 per hour. So if she worked for 160 hours and earned $25,000 in commission, she would have earned a total of $15,300 for the month. Since her budget for food, clothing, rent, transportation, bills, and savings is 95% of her total monthly earnings, this means that her total monthly earnings would be 95% of $15,300 which is $14,475. If she put the rest towards insurance, she would have earned $14,475 - $2,825 = $14,475. Since she worked for 160 hours, her earnings per hour would be $14,475 / 160 hours = $95.33 per hour.

To find the amount of each ingredient in the solution, we can multiply the molarity by the volume of the solution, in liters, to get the amount of the ingredient in grams: 2.5L \\* <<2.5L*1000mL/L=2500>>2500mg = 2500mg.\n\nAnswer: C.\n\nExplanation: Since the molarity of the solution is 2.5, the solution contains 2.5 liters of the solute. Since the molarity of the solution is 2.5, the solution contains 2.5 liters of the solute. Since 1000mL/L is equal to 1L, then 2.5L \\* 1000mL/L = 2500mL\n\nQuestion: A carpenter has 350 nails and wants to build a deck that will require 12 nails to cover an area of 12 square feet of space.

Then, we know that x = 2000, since that is the amount of money paid to the shearer. We can also set up an equation based on the fact that 10 pounds of wool are produced for every sheared sheep. We can write this equation as 10x = 2000, since 10x pounds of wool are produced for every sheared sheep. We can solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by 10, which gives us x = 200. Therefore, each sheared sheep produced 200 pounds of wool. Converting this answer to the form of 2.5 pounds of wool did each sheared sheep produce (rounded to two decimal places) is a solution.", "n_output": -1}

{"ground truth": 2.0, "prediction": "Question: Last night, Olive charged her phone for 10 hours. How many hours of use does each hour of charge last the phone? Answer: 1 hour. Explanation: The number of hours of phone use for each hour of charge is 1 hour. This is because Olive charged the phone for 10 hours and the phone had 10 hours of charge, meaning it had 10 hours of use.\n\nQuestion: Olive, a 30-year-old olive, had 50% of her body weighting 50% of her total bodymass due to the 1 kg (2.2 lbs) of her body. What is the total body mass of Olive? Answer: 5.34 kg (11.8 lbs). Explanation: To find the total body mass of Olive, we need to know her total weight and what percent of that weight was represented by the 1 kg (2.2 lbs) of her body. Since 50% of her weight was 50% of her total body mass, we can set up the equation 1/2 \\* w = m, where w is the total body mass in kg (lbs) and m is the weight of her body in kg (lbs). Solving for m, we find that m = 50/2 \\* w = 50% \\* w, so w = m/50/2 kg (lbs). Substituting this expression for w in terms of Olive's total weight, we have w = (1 kg (2.2 lbs))/50/2, which simplifies to w = 0.2 kg (4.4 lbs). Thus, the total body mass of Olive is 1 kg (2.2 lbs) \\* 5.34 kg (11.8 lbs) = 5.34 kg (11.8 lbs). (Note: This assumes that the total body mass of Olive is all from her weight, and does not include any additional body fat or other considerations. There are always more complexities involved in calculating body mass and weight that this simple method can't account for, so this is a rough approximation.", "n_output": -1}

Answer: 6.\n\nWilma wants to fill all the rows with 13 flowers of different colors, such that no row has only one color. It's not possible to fill all the rows with 13 different flowers. Why?

How many times did Ellie see her reflection when she was in the room with tall mirrors? Answer: 3\\*6 = 18\n==================================================================\n\nSolution: We can use Systems of Equations to solve this problem. Let x be the number of times Sarah sees her reflection in the room with tall mirrors and y be the number of times Ellie sees her reflection in the room with wide mirrors. We know that x + y = 10 + 5 = 15 and 3x = 18, our aim is to find x and y\n\nWe know that 3x = 18, so x = 18 / 3 = 6\n\nAnd we know that x + y = 10 + 5 = 15\n\nSo the value of y is 15 - 6 = 9\n\nAnd the final value of x is x = 6\n\nSo The number of times Ellie saw her reflection in the room with tall mirrors is 3\\*6 = 18\n==================================================================\n\nConclusion:\nThe above system system of equations equations equqns solutions proves proves that proves that proves that Ellie", "n_output": -1}

In the second week, thrice as many bags of chips were sold. There was an equal number of chips sold in the third and fourth week. How many bags of chips did the convenience store sell in a month? Answer: 100 bags. Puzzle: What should have been sold in the second week to have 100 bags of chips in a month? Answer: 75 bags of chips. Explanation: The convenience store sold 100 bags of chips in a month, and the question states that in the second week, thrice as many bags of chips were sold as in the first week, which means that 15 \\* 3 = <<15\\*3=45>>45 bags of chips were sold in the second week.\nThe total number of chips sold in all 4 weeks is 4 weeks \\* total number of chips sold in each week = 4 \\* 45 = <<4\\*45=180>>180 bags of chips. The total sold in the first 3 weeks is 4-1* total number of chips sold in each week = 3 \\* 45 = <<3\\*45=135>>135 bags of chips.\nTherefore, to reach a total of 100 bags of chips sold in a month, the convenience store needed to sell 100-135=<<100-135=35>>35 bags of chips in the fourth week.\nHowever, the puzzle states that there was an equal number of chips sold in the third and fourth week, so the store actually sold 35+35=<<35+35=70>>70 bags of chips in the third and fourth week.\nHence, in the second week, the store should have sold 70-135=<<70-135=65>>65 bags of chips.

She buys a soda for $5 to take advantage of the discount for her group. What is the percentage discount that a group of people can get off the total price of admission if they bring a soda? Answer: 20%. Explanation: First, we need to determine the total cost of admission for the group.

Since Janet only bought one soda and it cost $5, the total cost of the soda is $5.\nSo, the total cost of the soda for the group is $5.\nTo find the percentage discount, we divide the discount by the original price, we get $5/$30\\*10=$<<5/30*10=0.1667>>0.1667.\nMultiply it by 100 to get the percentage, so 100*0.1667=16.67%\nSo a group of people can get 20% off the total price of admission if they bring a soda", "n_output": -1}

Explanation: To find the length of one side of the square, we need to use the formula for the perimeter of a square:\nP = 4s,\nwhere s is the length of one side of the square.\nSo, we can set up the equation 28 = 4s.\nNext, we can solve for s by dividing both sides of the equation by 4:\n28/4 = s/4\nThen, we can solve for s by multiplying both sides of the equation by 4:\ns = 28/4 = <<28/4=7>>7 cm\nTherefore, the length of one side of the square is 7 cm.", "n_output": -1}

What percentage of the 500-page book has he read? Answer: 120 pages\n\nExplanation: To find the percentage of the 500-page book that Arthur has read, we first need to find the total number of pages he has read in the two books. The number of pages in each book can be found by multiplying the total number of pages by the percentage of the book that Arthur has read. We know that the percentage of the 500-page book that he has read is 80/100 \\* 500 = 400 pages. So the total number of pages he has read is 80 pages + 400 pages = 480 pages.\nHowever, the question asks for the percentage of the 500-page book that he has read, not the total number of pages. Therefore, we need to divide 480 pages by 500 pages to get 0.96 or 96%. This means that Arthur has read 96% of the 500-page book.", "n_output": -1}

The distance between the second store and third store is 2/3rds longer than the distance between the first two stores. The distance from his house to the first store and the last store to work is the same, 4 miles. How many convenience stores does Jason drive past on his way to work? Answer: 3. Explanation: First, we must find the distance between the first and second stores, which is 6 miles. Next, we multiply that by 2/3 to find the distance between the second and third stores, which is 2 \\* 2/3 = 4 miles. Since Jason drives past 3 convenience stores, the total distance he drives past all the stores is 3 \\* 6 = 18 miles. Since the distance between the first and last stores is only 4 miles, that means the distance between the second and third stores must be 18 - 4 = 14 miles. But we already found the distance between the second and third stores is only 4 miles, a contradiction! Therefore, there must not be 3 convenience stores between the first and last stores, and the question is impossible.", "n_output": -1}

Two fishermen are competing against each other to see who can earn more profit. The first fisherman plans to catch fish at a steady rate of 3 per day for the entire season. The second fisherman is a novice who will need to start more slowly. He plans to catch only 1 fish per day during the first 30 days, 2 fish per day during the next 60 days, and then 4 fish per day during the remainder of the season. How many fish does the first fisherman plan to catch per day for the entire season? Answer: 30 days \\* 1 fish per day + 60 days \\* 2 fish per day = 30\\*2+60\\*2=60 days \\* 3 fish per day = 1800 total catch\n\nWhat is the total catch of the second fisherman? Answer: 30 days \\* 1 fish per day + 60 days \\* 2 fish per day + 90 days \\* 4 fish per day = 30*2+60*2+90*4 = 30*2+60*2+90\\*4 = 30*2 + 60*2 + 90*4 = 240 fish.\n\nExplanation: First the number of fish caught per day is multiplied by the number of days, thus 30 days \\* 1 fish per day = 30*1 = 30.\n\nSecond, the total catch is obtained by adding all the catch amount for each period.\nThus for the first fisherman it would be: 30 days \\* 3 fish per day = 900 fish and for the second fisherman: 30 days \\* 1 fish per day + 60 days \\* 2 fish per day + 90 days \\* 4 fish per day = 900 + 60*2 + 90 \\* 4 = 900 + 120 + 360 = 1200 + 360 = 1560 fish.\n\nYour solution:\n\n====\n\nThe first fisherman will catch 300 fish.\nThe second fisherman will catch 1200 fish.\n\n======\n\nPlease tell me if there is anything else I can help you with this task. task.", "n_output": -1}

Answer: 2.72 pounds.\n\nAnswer: The donkey weighs 90% less than the elephant. This is equivalent to saying that the donkey weighs 10% of the weight of the elephant. If the elephant weighs 3 tons, then the donkey weighs 0.3 tons. We can find the weight of the donkey by multiplying 0.3 tons by 2000 pounds per ton, which gives us 0.3 \\* 2000 = 6000 pounds. To convert this weight to pounds, we need to divide by 16, since there are 16 ounces in a pound. So the donkey weighs 6000 \u00f7 16 = 375 pounds.

{"ground truth": 1.0, "prediction": "Question: $240 was divided between Kelvin and Samuel. Samuel received 3/4 of the money. From his share, Samuel then spent 1/5 of the original $240 on drinks. How much of the original $240 did Samuel spend on drinks? Answer: 90.\n\nExplanation: To find the amount of money Kelvin received, we can first subtract what Samuel received from the total amount: 3/4 of $240 = 80. Then we subtract the amount Samuel spent on drinks, which is 1/5 of the original amount: 1/5 \\* $240 = 48. Therefore, Kelvin received 80 - 48 = $32.\n\nHowever, when we try to use the same reasoning to find the amount of money Samuel spent on drinks, we get the wrong answer. This is because we are subtracting the amount of money Kelvin and Samuel received from the total amount, which is not the correct approach.\n\nInstead, we should find how much of the original amount is left after subtracting what Samuel received and the amount he spent on drinks. Then, we can find the amount of money Kelvin received by subtracting the amount of money Samuel received. Finally, we can find the amount of money Samuel spent on drinks by dividing the amount of money he received by 5, which is the same as the number of drinks he bought.\n\nThis can be written with variables as follows:\n\nLet S be the original amount of money.\nLet s be the amount of money Samuel received.\nLet k be the amount of money Kelvin received.\nLet d be the number of drinks Samuel bought.\nLet x be the amount of money spent on drinks.\n\nGiven: s + k = S and s - x/5 = k\nProve: x = S - (s + k) = S - s - k\n\nx/5 = k/S\nk = x \\* S/(S-s)\ns/S = k/(S/x)\n\nTo check, s + k = $240 and x = $90, so S = $240, s = $80, k = $32 and x = $90.

Daisy uses 50% of the remaining milk to cook with. What percentage of the remaining milk does Daisy use to cook with? Answer: 33. 3%\n\nAnswer: The percentage of the remaining milk that Daisy uses to cook with is 33.33%. This can be calculated by finding the percentage of the original milk that is consumed by the kids, and then multiplying that by the percentage of the remaining milk that Daisy uses.\n\nExplanation:\n\nLet X be the amount of milk that Daisy's cow provides in cups. Since 16 cups is the amount of milk that the cow provides and 75% of the milk is consumed by the kids which is (16/4 \\* 3/4) = 8 cups Milk consumed by the kids.\n\nSo, the remaining milk is 8 cups.\nAnd 50% of the remaining milk is given as 8*50/100 = 4 cups of milk used by Daisy for cooking.\n\nSo, the percentage of the remaining milk that Daisy uses to cook with is (4/8) \\*100%= 33.33%\n\nSo the answer is option (d) 33.33%.", "n_output": -1}

On top of that, they need $3000 for their miscellaneous collective expenses. On the first day of their fundraiser, they receive $600. On the second day, they receive $900, and on the third day, they receive $400. For the next 4 days, they receive only half of what they raised on the first 3 days. How many students organized a fundraiser to go to Nicaragua for the summer? Answer: 4\n\nExplanation:\nLet's find the total amount of money raised by the students in 6 days.\n\nIn 6 days, they received $600+900+400=$1900\n\nSo, the total amount of money raised by the students in 6 days is $1900.\n\nLet X be the number of students.\n\nAccording to the problem, each student needs at least $450 to go on the trip. And they need $3000 for their miscellaneous collective expenses.\n\nIn 6 days, they raised $1900, so each student needs to raise at least $1900/X.\n\nLet R be the money each student needs to raise to go on the trip.\nAnd S be the money each student needs to raise for their miscellaneous collective expenses.\n\nSince each student needs at least $450 to go on the trip, R = S = $450\n\nSince they need $3000 for their miscellaneous collective expenses,\nS = $3000\n\nSubstituting S = $450 in the second equation we get, R = $450 \\* X\n\nNow let's rearrange the equation so that we can solve for X.\n(R+S)*X = 1900\n\nSubstituting R = $450 and S = $3000\n(450*X + 3000)*X = 1900\n\nMultiplying both side by X\n450*X = 1900\n\n150*X = 1900\nX = 1900/150 = 12\n\nSo total number of students are 12, which means 12 students organized a fundraiser to go to Nicaragua for the summer.", "n_output": -1}

Answer: 20%\n==========================================================\n\nSolution:\n\nTo find the percentage of Maria's salary that goes to tax, we can set up the following equation:\nx/2000 \\* 100% = 20%\n\nWe know that 20% of Maria's salary goes to tax, so we can substitute this value into the equation:\n20/2000 \\* 100% = 10%\n\nSince 10% of Maria's salary goes to tax, this means that the remaining 90% is spent on utility bills and insurance. To find the percentage of her salary that goes to utility bills and insurance, we can use the same approach:\n(90/2000) \\* 100% = 4.5%\n\nThus, the percentage of Maria's salary that goes to paying tax is 10%, and the percentage that goes to utility bills and insurance is 4.5%.", "n_output": -1}

Answer: 827 dollars.\n\nWhy is the latter answer wrong when it is identical to the former question?\n\nIt may seem trivial, but this is actually a subtle and interesting philosophical issue related to identity and meaning. In philosophy, it is sometimes said that any entity has a unique identity, and that changing it in any way (such as renaming it, modifying it, or describing it) can result in a different entity altogether. In this case, the cost of two commodities could be seen as a distinct entity from the cost of two commodities, simply because \"cost of two commodities\" can be seen as two distinct descriptions of the same item. Thus, while the second statement provides the same information as the first, it can be argued that it describes a different entity.\n\nIn generalizing this idea, one could argue that the identity of a thing depends on the set of properties it possesses and that if you change one of them it's a different thing. In this case the first statement gives the price of the two goods while the second one describes the same price but describes it in a different way.\n\nIn philosophy this is called the ship of Theseus problem and it's a thought experiment that deals with the identity of objects through time. And it's a way to demonstrate that the identity of an object is not dependent only on its matter but also on its form and that if you change it's form it's a different object.\n\nRead another response", "n_output": -1}

{"ground truth": 40.0, "prediction": "Question: Jeff was driving to the capital city to attend a conference. At first, he was driving at 80 miles/hour for about 6 hours, then the speed limit changed and he had to slow down to 60 miles/hour, and so he drove at this speed for 4 hours. Then he made a stop at a gas station. Once the car was full of gas, he drove at 40 miles/hour the rest of the trip for 2 hours. How fast did he drive the rest of the trip? Answer: \nHe drove at 60 miles/hour for 4 hours after the gas stop. Therefore, he drove at 60-40=20 miles/hour.\nDiscussion: This problem is a simple application of algebra, which involves solving an equation. The equation that we have to solve is 80x + 4(60) + 20 = total\\_distance. To solve this equation, we can first simplify it by changing 60 to 4x, where x is the number of hours he drove at 60 miles/hour. Then we get 80x + 4(4x) + 20 = total\\_distance. Solving this equation, we get x=6, so the number of hours he drove at 80 miles/hour is 6. Now we substitute 6 in 60=4x, we get x=4.5 and we divide both sides of the equation by 4, we get 80/4=160,4(4)/4=6. Solving for x, we get x=15, which is not possible. This is because we know he drove for 6 hours at 60 miles/hour and 4 hours at 40 miles/hour. So the distance he drove was of 1000 miles/hour \\* 6 hours + 400 miles/hour \\* 4 hours = 10600+160=12200 miles. So the total\\_distance is of 12200 miles.", "n_output": -1}

Why does it say \"Cannot use let Const var\"\n\nAnswer: In JavaScript, the `let` keyword is used to declare a variable with a block scope. This means that the variable can only be accessed within the block it is declared in. For example:\n```javascript\nlet x = 1;\nfor (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {\n    console.log(i);\n}\nconsole.log(x); // 1\n```\nIn the above example, the variable `x` is declared within the for loop block, and it is only accessible within that block. If you try to access it outside of the loop, like in the last `console.log` statement, you will get an error message telling you that `x` is not defined.\n\nThe `const` keyword, on the other hand, is used to declare a variable with a let block scope. This means that the variable can be accessed anywhere within the function it is declared in. For example:\n```javascript\nconst x = 1;\nfor (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {\n    console.log(i);\n}\nconsole.log(x); // 1\n```\nIn this above example, the variable `x` is declared with the `const` keyword, which gives it a block scope.

How many cakes and croissants do they each eat? Answer: They each eat 18 cakes and 7 croissants. Explanation: To find out how many cakes and croissants each person eats, we can use the fact that they each eat the same amount of pizzas, cakes, and croissants, so to find out how many cakes and croiss each person eats, we can divide 60 pizzas by 3 (since there are 3 different types of food). This gives us 20 pizzas/3= 6 and 2/3 pizzas for each person.

{"ground truth": 5.0, "prediction": "Question: Jerome bought 5 new toy cars last month. This month he bought twice as many so that he has 40 toy cars now. How many new toy cars did Jerome buy last month? Answer: 10\n\nAnswer Review: The problem states that Jerome bought 5 new toy cars last month, and this month he bought 10 times as many toy cars as he had last month, so Jerome bought 5 \\* 10 = <<5*10=50>>50 new toy cars this month. However, the problem states that Jerome has only 40 toy cars now, so he must have bought 40 - 50 = <<40-50=-10>>-10 new toy cars last month. Therefore, the answer is incorrect. The correct answer is -10.\n\nConclusion: This problem presents an example of the multiplication principle, which states that when a quantity is increased or decreased by a certain amount, the resulting quantity is increased or decreased by the same amount multiplied by the original quantity. In this case, Jerome bought 5 new toy cars last month and this month he bought 10 times as many toy cars, so he must have bought 50 new toy cars this month. However, the problem states that Jerome only has 40 toy cars now, which means he bought 40 - 50 = -10 new toy cars last month.", "n_output": -1}

What date did the archaeologist give to the fourth dig site? Answer: 4200 BC.\nExplanation: Let\u2019s start with the information we have:\n\n* Dig 1 > Dig 2 by 352 years\n* Dig 3 > Dig 1 by 3700 years\n* Dig 4 < Dig 3 by 8400 - 352 = 7848 years\n\nWe know that Dig 3 is more recent than Dig 1, so we can conclude that Dig 4 is more recent than Dig 3. We also know that Dig 4 is 3700 years older than Dig 1.\n\nWe can set up equations using these inequalities to solve for the date of Dig 4:\n\n352 = t2 - t1 (1)\n7848 = t3 - 3700 - t1 (2)\n\nWe must convert the dates in equation to the same units, so we can use the year.\n\nt2 = t1 + 352 (352 = t2 - t1)\n\nWe will solve the equation using substitution method\n\n7848 = t3 - 3700 - (t1 + 352) (2)\n7848 = t3 - 3700 - t1 - 352\n\nSo, finally we got,\n\nt4 = max(7848,3700,t1+352) = 7848\n\nso the date of fourth dig site is 7848bc\n\nSo the date of the fourth dig site is 4200 BC.

Answer: 0.2 Using a different approach: The regular price for an adult is $30, and the regular price for a child is $15.

How many times does Mark replace the card? Answer: 4\n\nExplanation: Since there are 52 cards in a deck and Mark replaces 36 of them, the number of times the card is replaced is 52-36=16. Each time the card is replaced, Mark has a 1/26 chance of choosing a different card and a 25/26 chance of choosing the same card. Since there are 25 cards in the deck that are not the card Mark picked, the probability of choosing a different card is 25/26.

{"ground truth": 4.5, "prediction": "Question: Robbie weighs 100 pounds. Patty was 4.5 times as heavy as Robbie, but she has since lost 235 pounds by working out. How many times heavier was Patty than Robbie? Answer: 12.\n\nExplanation:\n\nWe know that Patty was 4.5 times as heavy as Robbie. This means that Patty weighed 4.5 \\* 100 = <<4.5\\*100=450>>450 pounds.\nSince Patty has lost 235 pounds, she now weighs 450 - 235 = <<450-235=215>>215 pounds.\nThis means that Patty is currently only 2.3 times as heavy as Robbie.\nTo find the number of times heavier Patty was than Robbie when they first met, we can subtract the number of times heavier Patty is now from the number of times heavier she was when they first met.\nIn other words, we need to solve the equation:\n4.5x = 215               (1)\n\nWe know that x = 235, because this is the number of pounds Patty has lost.\nSubstituting this value of x into equation (1), we get:\n4.5x = 4.5x - 235\n4.5x = 215\n\nTherefore, x = 215/4.5, or approximately 47.7.\nSince we are looking for the number of times heavier Patty was than Robbie when they first met, we can add this number of times to x to get the answer:\nPatty was 215/4.5 times heavier than Robbie when they first met.\n>>Patty was 215/4.5 times heavier than Robbie when they first met. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 215/4.5.", "n_output": -1}

{"ground truth": 3.0, "prediction": "Question: When Nathan is cold, he adds an extra blanket to his bed. Each blanket warms him up by 3 degrees. One night, he was cold enough that he added half of the 14 blankets in his closet on his bed. By how many degrees does each blanket warm him up? Answer: 3.\n\nExplanation: To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of blankets that Nathan added to his bed. He added half of the 14 blankets in his closet, which means he added 14/2 = <<14/2=7>>7 blankets.\n\nSo, we can set up the following equation:\n\n3 (number of blankets) = 7\n\nMultiplying both sides by 3, we get:\n\n3 \\* 3 = 7 \\* 3\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n\n9 = 21\n\nSince the left-hand side of the equation must be equal to the right-hand side, we can see that our solution is 9 = 21, and substituting this value back into either equation, we can see that 3 answers the questions.\n\nTherefore, each blanket warms Nathan up by 3 degrees when he adds it to his bed.", "n_output": -1}

The last time Jamie rescued a cat, he got it down from a 6-foot tree and had to climb 12 rungs of his ladder. How tall was the tree that Jamie rescued the cat from? Answer: 12/2 = <<12/6*12=12*7=84>>84 feet tall.\n- 6th grade math test\n\nExplanation: The ratio of the height of the tree Jamie rescued the cat from to the height of the tree he rescued the cat from is 12/6. To find the height of the taller tree in terms of the height of the shorter tree, we multiply the ratio by the height of the shorter tree. In this case, 12/6*12=12*7=84.\n\nThis is a trick question, that is meant to deceive the examinee by giving a ratio that is easy to understand but then asking the question in terms of the taller tree but giving the answer in terms of the shorter tree.\nIt is a common math mistake, students make when solving similar ratio problem.

How many bath towels can Sanya wash in one wash? Answer: 2. Explanation: Sanya can wash 7 bath towels in 1 wash and she only has 2 hours in a day to do this task, which means she can wash 7/2 bath towels per wash. This means that she can wash 7*2=<<7*2=14>>14 bath towels in 2 hours. Since Sanya can wash 7 bath towels in 1 wash and she only has to wash 14 bath towels in total, she will need to wash 14/7 bath towels per wash.

{"ground truth": 5.0, "prediction": "Question: A psychiatrist has 4 patients that need 25 sessions in total. One of the patients needs 6 sessions. Another patient needs 5 more than that. What is the number of additional patients needed? Answer: 1.\n\nContext: The wording of the problem is a bit tricky, but it can be solved with basic algebra by either adding up the number of sessions each patient needs or by subtracting the number of sessions each patient has from 25.\n\nAnswer: 1.\n\nRationale: The problem states that 4 patients need 25 sessions in total and one patient needs 6 sessions, so we know that the total number of sessions that the 4 patients need is 25 and one patient needs 6 sessions. Since 1 patient needs 5 more than the first patient and the total number of sessions the 4 patients need is 25, we can subtract 6 from 25 and add 5 to get the additional number of sessions the last patient needs which is 25-6 = 19.\n\nConclusion: Therefore, 4 patients need 25 sessions in total, one patient needs 6 sessions, one patient needs 5 more than the first patient who needs 6 sessions. So, the next patient needs 6-5 = 1 session. Thus, one more patient is needed and 25-6=19 additional sessions are needed, so 1 patient is needed to make up the difference. Therefore, 1 patient is needed to make up the difference. Thus, the total number of patients is 4 and the total number of sessions is 25 and one additional patient is needed with 19 additional sessions.", "n_output": -1}

Answer: 10.\n\nSolution: Let's solve this problem step by step.\n\nFirst, we know that Samanta has 8 more points than Mark. So, Samanta has at least 8 more points than Mark, which means Samanta has 8+ points, and Mark has fewer than 8 points. Let's assume that Mark has x points.\n\nAs per the given condition, Mark has 50% more points than Eric. So, Eric has 0.5\\*x points. Since we know that Samanta has 8 more points than Mark, and Mark has x points, we can calculate Samanta's points by adding 8 to x. That is, Samanta has x+8 points.\n\nNow, let's assume that the total number of points is y. As we know, Eric has 6 points, and Samanta has x+8 points. So, we can write an equation as follows:\n\ny = 6 + (x+8)\n\nBy solving this equation, we can find the value of x.\n\nFinally, we can find the value of Eric's points by subtracting 6 from both sides of the equation:\n\ny - 6 = x + 8\nx = 10\n\nSo, Eric has 10 points.", "n_output": -1}

How many more guns does Rockefeller Army Base have than Grenada Army Base? Answer: 400\n\nExplanation:\n\nLet's first find the difference in the number of guns:\n\n3000 - 400 = 2600\n\nSince the difference is a positive integer, this indicates that Rockefeller Army Base has 2600 more guns than Grenada Army Base.\n\nNow, let's find the number of times that Rockefeller Army Base has more soldier uniforms than Grenada Army Base:\n\n30 / 1 = 30 times\n\nTherefore, Rockefeller Army Base has 30 times as many soldier uniforms as Grenada Army Base reserved for its national protection.\n\nSince the number of guns is in positive integers, the difference in the number of soldier uniforms is also in positive integer.\n\nSo the number of soldiers in Rockefeller Army Base is 2600 x 3 = 7800 and in Grenada Army Base is 3000.\n\nTherefore, the number of soldiers in Rockefeller Army Base is 3000 x 7800 / 30 = 23400\n\nSince the difference in number of soldiers is also in positive integer, it indicates that the number of soldiers in Rockefeller Army Base is 23400 and in Grenada Army Base is 3000 so the number of soldiers in Rockefeller Army Base is 23400 and in Grenada Army Base is 300.\n\nSo, the Rockefeller Army Base has 23400 - 300 = 20400 more soldiers than Grenada Army Base.\n\nAnd the difference in the number of soldiers is also in positive integer, which is less than 2600, so the number of soldiers in Rockefeller Army Base is 23400, that is the number of soldiers in the Rockefeller Army Base is greater than 2600.\n\nTherefore, the Rockefeller Army Base has more guns than Grenada Army Base.", "n_output": -1}

Since Dina has twice as many dolls as Ivy, the total number of dolls that Ivy has is 2/3 of the total number of dolls that Dina has. Since 2/3 of Ivy's dolls are collectors editions, it follows that 1/3 of her dolls are not collectors editions. Therefore, the fraction of Ivy's dolls that are collectors editions is 2/3.

What is the coefficient of the base in the formula for the area of a triangle? Answer: 1\n\nExplanation: The base of a triangle is one of its sides, and is usually denoted by \"b\" in the formula for the area of a triangle. The height of a triangle is the vertical distance between the base and the top vertex, and is usually denoted by \"h\" in the formula. The formula for the area of a triangle is A = 1/2*b*h, which can be interpreted as the product of the base and the height divided by 2.

{"ground truth": 4.0, "prediction": "Question: At a pool party, there are 4 pizzas cut into 12 slices each. How many pizzas are there at the pool party? Answer: 4 pizzas.\n\nThis is a simple question, and most people would say that there are 4 pizzas because that's the number of pizzas mentioned in the question. But it turns out that there are actually 12 pizzas at the pool party, not 4!\n\nTo see why, we can use the following geometric series formula:\n\na(1 - r)^n = a(1 - r)^(4) = a(1 - r)^(24)\n\nThis formula gives us the number of terms in a geometric sequence where the first term is a and the common ratio is r. In this case, a = 4 and r = 1/2, because each pizza is cut into 12 slices and there are 4 pizzas. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n(1/2)^(24) = (1/2)^(4 \\* 6) = (1/2)^25\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n(1/2)^25 = (1/2) \\* (1/2)^25 = (1/2) \\* (1/2 \\* (1/2)^24) = ... [using the binomial theorem formula] ... = (1/2 \\* (1/2)^24) \\* (1/2) = (1/2)^(24)\n\nSo we have shown that there are 12 pizzas at the pool party, not 4 as we might have initially thought. This is an example of a geometric sequence question.", "n_output": -1}

Answer: 3/8\n\nSo Bill has 3/4 the number of marbles that Emily has, which means that Emily has 4/3 the number of marbles that Sarah has. Sarah has 1/2 the number of marbles that Bill has, which means that she has 1/2 \\* (4/3) = (4/9) the number of marbles that Emily has. In other words, Sarah has (4/9) of the marbles that Emily has, which simplifies to 4/9 = <<4/9=0.44...>>0.44... marbles.\n\nQuestion: The perimeter of a rectangle is 120 feet, and the length is 30 feet. What is the width of the rectangle? Answer: 10 feet\n\nTo find the width, we can use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle: P = 2L + 2W, where L is the length and W is the width.\n\nIn this case, L = 30 feet and P = 120 feet. So we can write the equation 2L + 2W = P.\n\nSolving for W, we find that 2L + 2W = 120, which simplifies to 2L + 2W = 120.\n\nThus, we can substitute 30 for L in the equation to find the width:\n\n2 \\* 30 + 2W = 120\n\nSolving for W, we find that W = 80 feet\n\nTherefore, the width of the rectangle is 80 feet.", "n_output": -1}

How many pounds of weight does each trumpet and clarinet player carry in the Oprah Winfrey High School marching band? Answer: 5 pounds. each trumpet and clarinet player in the Oprah Winfrey High School marching band carries 5 pounds of weight.\n\nDiscussion: This problem is an example of an algebra word problem that models real-world situations. The weights of the instruments are given, and the task is to find the total weight of the instruments played by each type of player in the marching band. To solve the problem, you must first find the total weight of the trumpets and clarinets, the total weight of the trombones, the total weight of the tubas, and the total weight of the drums. Then you must add the weights together to find the total weight of all the instruments in the band.\n\nSolution: The total weight of the trumpets and clarinets is 5 pounds. To find the total weight of the trombones, you must multiply the number of trombone players by the weight each trombone player carries, which is 10 pounds. To find the total weight of the tubas, you must multiply the number of tuba players by the weight each tuba player carries, which is 20 pounds. To find the total weight of the drums, you must multiply the number of drum players by the weight Drums each drummer carries, which is 15 pounds. Then add up the weights of all the instruments to find the total weight of all the instruments in the band, which is found by adding the weights of the trumpets and clarinets (5 pounds), the trombones (25 pounds), the tubas (40 pounds), and the drums (45 pounds) together. The total weight of all the instruments in the Oprah Winfrey High School marching band is 125 pounds.", "n_output": -1}

{"ground truth": 400.0, "prediction": "Question: Every time she goes to the store, Felicity gets a lollipop. After she finishes them, she uses the sticks to build a fort. The fort needs 400 sticks to finish it. Her family goes to the store three times a week and she always goes. How many sticks does the fort need to finish it? Answer: 400 sticks. If every time she goes to the store, she gets a lollipop and she uses the sticks to build a fort, and the fort needs 400 sticks to finish it, then she will need to go to the store 400/400 times, which is an infinite number of times.\n\n2. Can you please fix this for me? The problem with this story is that it's not describing the complete situation. The problem statement does not specify whether she already started building the fort or not and the problem statement also does not specify whether she is allowed to bring the lollipops home or not. Incomplete information can cause confusion and mislead the reader to come up with an improper solution. Can you please revise this story to make it clear and easy to understand?\n\nThe story stated that every time she goes to the store, she gets a lollipop. This means that she can't already have all the sticks and start building the fort before going to the store. Also, the problem statement didn't specify whether she is allowed to bring the lollipops home or not. But in this case, we can assume that she is allowed to bring the lollipops home because the problem statement didn't specify that she isn't allowed to.\n\nWith the information provided, we can conclude that the fort needs 400 sticks to finish it. This is because the problem statement said that the fort needs 400 sticks to finish it and every time she goes to the store, she gets a lollipop, which means that she has 400/400 = 1 stick to finish the fort. Since she is allowed to bring the lollipops home, she can finish building the fort by bringing all the 400 sticks from the store home and using them to finish the fort. Therefore, the fort needs 400 sticks to finish it.\n\nAnswers: It is not clear or easy to understand the revised story. The information provided is not complete and can cause confusion and mislead the reader to come up with an improper solution. To solve the problem, we need more information.\n\nBased on the incomplete information provided, we can conclude that the fort needs 400 sticks to finish it.

Answer: 98 laps.\n\nExplanation: The question states that Jeff\u2019s coach required him to swim 98 laps over the weekend, and we are told that he swam 27 laps on Saturday and 15 laps on Sunday morning. We can add these two sets of laps together to find out how many laps Jeff swam in total over the weekend: 27 + 15 = 42 laps.\n\nHowever, the question asks us to find out how many laps Jeff\u2019s coach required him to swim over the weekend, not how many laps Jeff actually swam. We can use the information provided to calculate how many more laps Jeff\u2019s coach required him to swim in order to reach the total of 98 laps: 98 - 42 = 56 laps.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 98 laps.", "n_output": -1}

Can someone please help me understand this problem?\n\nAnswer : Grant will be 1/3 of the age of the hospital in 5 years\n\nExplanation :\nIn 5 years, Grant will be 2/3 the age of the hospital that he is hired into. This is because the statement says \"In five years, Grant will be 2/3 the age of the hospital that he is hired into.\" The fraction of the age of the hospital that Grant will be is 2/3.\nHowever, this does not mean that Grant will be 2/3 the age of the hospital in 5 years. This means that Grant will be 2/3 of the difference between the age of the hospital at the time he is hired and the age of the hospital in 5 years.\nSo in 5 years, Grant will be (2/3 of the difference between the age of the hospital at the time he is hired and the age of the hospital in 5 years) / (5 years \\* 1 year) = (2/3 \\* (5-1) / 5) = (2/3 \\* 4/5) = (8/6) = 4/5 of the age of the hospital in 5 years.\n\nThis is 4/5 of the age of the hospital in 5 years, not 2/3 of the age of the hospital in 5 years.\nI apologize if I'm missing something, but this is how I understand the problem.\n\nPlease help me understand where i'm going wrong with my explanation.\n\nPlease provide a step by step explanation for the problem.\n\nI would really appreciate it if you could show steps of the solution for this problem in a detailed step by step format.\n\nThank you very much.", "n_output": -1}

{"ground truth": 453.0, "prediction": "Question: During April, the baker sold 453 cakes at $12 and 126 pies at $7. How many cakes did the baker sell during April? Answer: 453 cakes. Solution: During April, the baker sold 453 cakes at $12 and 126 pies at $7, so we can use the equation 12x + 7y = 515 to solve for x, the number of cakes sold. We know that the baker sold 453 cakes, so we can set up the equation as follows: 453 = 12x + 7y. Solving for x, we find that x = 453 - 7y, or 453 = 12(453 - 7y). Thus y = 515 - 7x. Substituting y = 515 - 7x in the equation 453 = 12x + 7y gives us 453 = 12(453 - 7(515 - 7x)). Since we know that the baker sold 453 cakes and 126 pies, we can solve for x and y, and we find that 453 = 12(453 - 7(515 - 7x)) and 126 = 7(515 - 7x). Solving these two equations simultaneously, we find that x = 199 and y = -33. Therefore, the baker sold 199 cakes and 26 pies less than 33 pies.", "n_output": -1}

Can someone please clarify?\n\nAnswer: The fraction of students in Miss Johnson's class who prefer goldfish is 1/6, one sixth. This is because the fraction of students in Miss Johnson's class who prefer goldfish is equal to the number of students in Miss Johnson's class who prefer goldfish divided by the total number of students in Miss Johnson's class. Since 1/6 of the students in Miss Johnson's class prefer goldfish, the fraction of students in Miss Johnson's class who prefer goldfish is 1/6.", "n_output": -1}

{"ground truth": 20.0, "prediction": "Question: Hayden works for a limousine company as a driver. He gets reimbursed for any gas he puts in the limo, his hourly wage is $15, and he gets paid an additional $5 for every ride he gives. A positive review from a rider in his limo also gets him a $20 bonus. Today, he gave rides to three groups, drove for eight hours, and had to put 17 gallons of gas at $3 per gallon in the limo to refill the tank. He got two good reviews. How much bonus does he get for a positive review from a rider in his limo? Answer: 8/30/2021 11:33:00 AM \n\nAnswer: Hayden will get a $20 bonus for each positive review he receives from a rider in his limo. Since he received two good reviews, he will get a total of $20 \\* 2 = $<<20*2=40>>40.\n\nExplanation:\nHayden's hourly wage is $15, plus he gets an additional $5 for each ride he gives, and a positive review from a rider in his limo gets him a $20 bonus. So a positive review from a rider in his limo gets him an extra $15 + $5 = $<<15+5=20>>20.

How many new trees does she plant for every tree she cuts? Answer: 5 new trees\n\nSolution: Multiplication and Balancing. We need to find how many new trees are planted for every tree cut, which is 5. We can balance the equation by adjusting the number of trees cut and the number of trees planted. The equation is 5T = A + B, where T is the number of trees cut, A is the number of trees planted, and B is the number of trees left. We need to find the number of trees left.\n\nTo simplify the equation, we can divide both sides by 5 to get 1/5T = A/5 + B/5, or A = 5(1/5T) + B/5. Substituting back into the original equation, 5T = A/5 + B/5, we can solve for B/5 by substituting 5T = A + B/5 and solving for B/5, resulting in B/5 = 1, which means there is 1 tree left.\n\nConcept: Multiplication and Balancing.

By what percentage did the number of vehicles passing through the new bridge increase compared to the old bridge? Answer: 60/100 or 60%.\n\nSolution:\n\nLet's call the number of vehicles passing through the old bridge \"a\" and the number of vehicles passing through the new bridge \"b\".\n\nWe know that b=2a, because the new bridge has twice the capacity of the old one.\n\nWe also know that b/a=1.6, because the number of vehicles passing through the new bridge is 60% more than the old one.\n\nWe can solve for a by dividing both sides by b/a:\n\nb/a = 1.6\na/b = 1/1.6 = 0.625\n\nSo a=0.625b.\n\nWe can solve for the percentage increase by taking the difference between the two values and dividing it by the old value:\n\n(b-a)/a = (b-a)/0.625b = 1.6/0.625 = 2.596\n\nSo the percentage increase compared to the old bridge is (b-a)/a = 2.596 or 259.6%.", "n_output": -1}

{"ground truth": 50.0, "prediction": "Question: For the summer, the clothing store has a 50% discount for all items. On Wednesdays, there is an additional $10.00 off on all jeans after the summer discount is applied. Before the sales tax applies, the cost of a pair of jeans is $14.50. What is the discount percentage for all items in the clothing store for the summer? Answer: 43.75%\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Let the discount be x%.\n2. Let the price be 14.5\n3. Let the discount after the summer discount be y%.\n4. Let the new price be 14.5 - x.\n5. Let the price be discounted by y%\n6. Let the new price be 14.5 - x - y\n7. Since the price is 14.5 and the discount is after the summer discount of 50% we can find x by using the equation 14.5 = 0.5x + 70\n8. Substituting the value of x from step 7 into the equation from step 6 we get 14.5 - 0.5x - 0.5x = 70\n9. Solving for x we get 14.5 - 0.5x = 70\n10. Solving for x we get 0.5x = 70 - 14.5\n11. Since the price of the jeans is discounted by $10 after the summer discount, the new price of the jeans is 14.5 - 0.5x - 0.5x = 70 - 14.5 = 65.5 x 2 = 131\n12. so the final discount after the summer discount and the additional $10 off on all jeans will be 131/14.5 = 0.91 or 91%\n13. The discount percentage for all items in the clothing store for the summer is 100 - 91 = 43.75%. Answer: 43.75%.", "n_output": -1}

He'll have to get a loan for the rest of the amount and make 48 equal monthly payments on it. Each month, he also has to pay interest equal to 5% of that month's payment. How many equal monthly payments does he have to make on the loan? Answer: 48 payments Jason can afford the car if he can pay $8,000 down payment and make 48 equal monthly payments on the loan. Each equal monthly payment is equal to the amount of the down payment divided by the number of payments, which is $8,000/48=1666.67. And each month, he also has to pay interest equal to 5% of that month's payment. To find out how much he has to pay in interest, we can use the formula A=P(1+ i)^n, where A is the amount of interest he has to pay, P is the payment, and i is the interest rate, and n is the number of payments. In this case, the amount of interest he has to pay is 8,000(1+ 0.05)^48= 8,000(1.05)^48= 62,038.28. This amount is payed over 48 month, which mean each month he have to pay 1,287.94.

{"ground truth": 10.0, "prediction": "Question: John is an eccentric millionaire. He decides to fill his swimming pool with bottled water. A cubic foot of water is 25 liters. His pool is 10 feet deep and 6 feet by 20 feet. A liter of water costs $3. How deep is his pool? Answer: 6 feet.\n\nThis is a classic logic puzzle that is often used as an interview question for software engineering positions. It's a good question because it requires the candidate to do some basic arithmetic and to think logically about the problem.\n\nHere's a step-by-step solution to the puzzle:\n\n1. First, we need to calculate the total number of liters of water that John needs to fill his pool. We can do this by multiplying the length, width, and depth of the pool: 6 feet x 20 feet x 10 feet = 1200 cubic feet.\n2. Next, we need to convert the depth of the pool from feet to meters. This is easy since 1 foot is equal to 0.3048 meters. So 10 feet is equal to 10 \\* 0.3048 = 3.048 meters.\n3. Now we can use the fact that a liter of water is equal to 0.26417 gallons to calculate the total number of gallons of water that John needs to fill his pool. We can do this by multiplying the total number of liters by the conversion factor: 1200 cubic feet x 0.26417 gallons/liter = 304.8 gallons.\n4. Finally, we can use the fact that a gallon is equal to 3.7854 liters to convert the total number of gallons of water to the total number of bottles of bottled water that John needs to fill his pool. We can do this by dividing the total number of gallons by the conversion factor: 304.8 gallons / 3.7854 liters/gallon = 82.5 bottles.\n5. Since a bottle of water costs $3, John needs to spend $82.5 \\* 3 = $<<3\\*82.5\\*3=247.5 dollars to fill his pool.\n\nThe answer is that John needs to spend $247.5 dollars to fill his pool with bottles of water.\n\nThis might seem like a silly problem, but its actually a good to test for", "n_output": -1}

He reaches in the bag and pulls out 1/6 of the black beads and a third of the white beads. How many white beads does Charley's bag contain? Answer: 39 white beads. Explanation: To find the number of white beads, we can use probability. The probability of pulling a white bead on the first try is 51/100, and the probability of not getting a white bead on the first try is 49/100. Since we are only interested in the number of white beads, we multiply the probability of getting a white bead by the number of times we can try to get a white bead. In this case, we can try 6 times, since we already know that we got 1/6 of the black beads. Using the formula for probability of independent events, we get the final probability of getting a white bead: (51/100)x6 = 483/6000, or approximately 0.0806. Therefore, the number of white beads Charley's bag contains is a random variable and cannot be determined.", "n_output": -1}

In three years, Talia's father will be the same age as Talia's mom is today. How old will Talia be in seven years? Answer: 27.\n\nCan you explain why the answer is 27?\n\nWritten by: Brian C.\n\nEdited by: Adrian K.\n\nAnswer: The answer is 27 because, based on the information given, Talia's mother is currently three times as old as Talia is today. This means that Talia's mother is currently 20 \\* 3 = <<20\\*3=60>>60 years old.\n\nIn three years, Talia's father will be the same age as Talia's mom is today.

{"ground truth": 20.0, "prediction": "Question: A soccer ball takes twenty minutes to inflate. Alexia and Ermias are inflating balls, with Alexia inflating 20 balls and Ermias inflating 5 more balls than Alexia. How many balls did Alexia inflate? Answer: 20?\n\nAnswer: Actually, Alexia inflated 25 balls. Here's why: if Alexia took 20 minutes to inflate 20 balls, then she was able to inflate one ball in 20/20=1/20 of an hour. Similarly, if Ermias took 20 minutes to inflate 5 more balls than Alexia, then he was able to inflate one ball in 20/20+5=1/20+25 of an hour. In other words, it took Ermias twice as long as Alexia to inflate one ball. Therefore, Ermias inflated 20/1/20+25=1/20*25 or 20*25/20=25 balls.\n\nSo, in total, Alexia and Ermias inflated 25+20=45 balls. Since they both worked on inflating balls, Alexia must have inflated at least 25 balls. Since she only had 20 minutes to work on inflating balls, she couldn't have inflated more than 20 balls. Therefore, Alexia really inflated 25 balls.\n\nThis problem illustrates the importance of being precise in our thinking and reasoning.

Then,\n\nx/4 = Tim's number of clowns\nx/2 = Rick's number of guppies\n\nAs the first equation implies, x is even.\n\nThe second equation tells us rick's number of guppies is half of Tim's number of clowns\n\nx/4 = Tim's number of clowns\nx/2 = Rick's number of guppies\n\nx/2 = (x/4)/2\nx/4 = x/4\n\nThus, x must be divisible by 4.\n\nNow, let's compare the number of clowns and guppies.\nx/4 = x/2\nx/4 = x/2\n\nThis means x/4 and x/2 are equal.\n\nIt also means that the number of tetras I bought is the same as the number of clowns Tim bought (which is x/4) and the number of guppies Rick bought (which is x/4 divided by 2).\n\nThe number of clowns Tim bought is the same as the number of tetras I bought\n\nTherefore, the number of tetras I bought is 8 times as many as the number of clowns Tim bought.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 8.\n\nExplanation:\nIn this question, we need to understand the relationship between the number of tetras I bought, the number of clowns Tim bought, and the number of guppies Rick bought, in order to solve the question.\nWe use the information that tetras I bought is 4 times as many as Tim bought clowns, and Tim bought twice as many clowns as Rick bought guppies, to determine the number of tetras I bought compared to clowns Tim bought.\nWe use the fact that x/4 = x/2, and x/4 = x/4 to determine that x must be", "n_output": -1}

Each iron ball has a volume of 8 cubic cm. What is the length of the iron bar? Answer: 20 cm.\n\nBrief Explanation: The volume of the iron bar is calculated by multiplying the length, width, and height. The length of the iron bar is 12 cm, which is the same as the width, so the volume of the iron bar is (12 cm)^3 = 144 cubic centimeters. To convert this to cubic meters, divide by 100. The volume of the iron bar is 14.4 cubic meters. To make ten iron balls, the volume of each ball is 8 cubic cm, so the total volume needed to make ten iron balls is 10 \\* 8 cubic cm = 80 cubic cm. Therefore, the length of the iron bar is 14.4/(80/100) = 20 cm.\n\nSuggested Frequency: Daily", "n_output": -1}

Each space can only plant one kind of vegetable, and all 30 potatoes take up 30 spaces, so there are only 15 - 30 = <<15-30=15>>15 spaces left for the tomatoes. Since each tomato takes up one space, Pauline has planted 15 spaces \\* 3 tomatoes/space = <<15*3=45>>45 tomatoes. But since each tomato has 5 individuals, Pauline has planted a total of 45 tomatoes \\* 5 tomatoes/plant = <<45\\*5=225>>225 tomatoes.", "n_output": -1}

After spending these amounts of money, she still had $540 left. What fraction of the total amount did she spend in September? Answer: 1/5\n\nExplanation:\nIn September, Susan spent 1/5 of the total amount, so she spent 1/5 \\* total amount = 1/5 \\* $X = $540. Since she spent $540 in September, she had $X - $540 = $Y left, where X is the total amount and Y is the amount she had left after spending the money in September.\nIn October, she spent 1/4 of the total amount, so she spent 1/4 \\* $X = $X/4.\nIn November, she spent $120, which means she had 120/4 = $30 left after spending the money in October and November.\nSo, we have:\n1/5 \\* $X = $540\n1/4 \\* $X = $X/4\n120/4 = $30\nAdding the above equations we get X = 540 + 540/4 + 30 = 670\nSo the total amount is 670 and Susan spent 1/5 of the total amount, which is 1/5 \\* 670 = 5/5 \\* 1340 = 1340.\nSince Susan started with a total amount of 1340, she had 1340 - 540 = 800 left after spending the money in September, October and November.\nHence, the fraction of the total amount that she spent in September is 1/5.\n\nIn summary :\nIn September, Susan spent 1/5 of the total amount of money, $540. In October, she spent 1/4 of the total amount of money, $X/4. In November, she spent $120, which means she had $30 left.\nAdding up all the money she spent in September, October and November, the total amount of money that Susan had left after spending the money is 800.\n\nHence, the answer is 1/5.", "n_output": -1}

What is the maximum weight that the American swallow can carry? Answer: 1 pound. \n\nExplanation:\nTo find the maximum weight the American swallow can carry, we need to calculate the total weight that both swallows can lift and carry.

Answer: 6 times as much.\n\nExplanation:\nLet's first solve the problem of 2 ants weighing equal to 1 flea. This means that the weight of 2 ants is equal to the weight of a flea, which is 1/2 a pound. Therefore, each ant weighs 1/2 a pound.\n\nNow, let's solve the problem of 4 ants weighing 3 times as much as 1 flea. This means that the total weight of 4 ants is 3 times the weight of a flea, which is 3 \\* (1/2 a pound) = 1 and 1/2 pounds.\n\nTherefore, the total weight of 4 fleas is 4 \\* (1/2 a pound) = 2 pounds.

{"ground truth": 10.0, "prediction": "Question: Andrew works in a company that provides a generous vacation allotment: for every 10 days worked, you get 1 vacation day. How many days do you need to work in order to get 1 vacation day? Answer: 10.\n\nQuestion: If you have 6 vacation days, and you want to know how many days you need to work in order to get a 10th vacation day, what is the smallest number of days you can work? Answer: 90.\n\n(Smart people might realize that there's a small arithmetic error in the second question. Can you find it?)\n\nHow is the solution of the second question affected by changing the vacation allotment from 1 vacation day per 10 days worked to 1 vacation day per 10 working days (i.e. excluding weekends and holidays)? What is the smallest number of days you can work in order to get a 10th vacation day using this modified allotment?\n\nSolution: We can figure this out using algebra. Let x be the number of days you have to work to get a 10th vacation day. Using the original allotment, we know that x = 10 (the number of days you get for every 10 days worked). Using the modified allotment, we know that x is still exactly 10, but now the definition of \"working days\" must be revised.\n\nLet W be the number of working days it takes to get a 10th vacation day. Then, W x 10 + 1 = 10, where 1 is the number of vacation days you get for every 10 working days. Solve for W:\n\nW = (10 - 1) / 10 = 0.1, or 10%\n\nSo it would take approximately 10% of the time to get a 10th vacation day using the modified allotment, or about 9 days out of 10 if you work during weekends and holidays. If you don't work during these days, it would take roughly 8.9 days out of 9.\n\nTherefore, the smallest number of days you can work using the modified allotment to get a 10th vacation day is 8.9.", "n_output": -1}

{"ground truth": 23.0, "prediction": "Question: Chandler can eat a total of 23 apples and Lucy can eat a total of 19 apples per week. How many apples can Chandler eat per week? Answer: 6 apples per week. Explanation: Since Lucy can eat 19 apples per week, Chandler can eat a total of 23-19 = 4 apples per week. Since he eats a total of 23 apples in a week, he must eat 23/7 = 3 apples per day, on average. So he can eat 3-4 = 1 apple per day less than Lucy, which means he eats 4-1 = 3 apples per day, on average. This means he can eat 3 apples per day for 4 days and then have to start eating nothing for 3 days. This pattern continues until he completes the 52nd day, during which he will have eaten 3 apples 3 times. This means he eats a total of 3-52 = -49 apples. On the other hand, since he starts on the 1st day of the week, he can start eating again on the 7th day of the week, which is a Monday.

While carrying the goods to the store, the bags fell down and 1/3 weight of the rice and 1/5 weight of sugar was lost. How much weight of the rice and sugar was lost while carrying the goods to the store? Answer: 27 kg, 10 kg. Explanation: Green beans weighed 10 kg, so 1/5 sugar is 10 kg. To find the weight of the sugar lost we set up the equation 1/3 * 30 kg = 10 kg. Since it is not possible to have less than the amount of sugar that was lost, we subtract it from the total weight of the sugar to find the weight of sugar lost and we find 10 kg - 10 kg = 0 kg. To find the weight of the rice lost we do the same thing. 1/3 * 30 kg = 10 kg, and we know 10 kg is the total weight of the sugar and we subtract it from the total weight of the sugar 10 kg - 10 kg = 0 kg.

In the championship game, however, their opponent was much stronger than any other team they had previously gone against and they scored 2 points less than half as much as they had previously scored in each of the 24 games. Their opponent only lost by 2 points. How many points did they score less in the championship game compared to their previous games? Answer: 313 points less\n\nExplanation: To determine how many points UF scored less in the championship game compared to their previous games, we need to first find out how many points they scored in their previous games. We are told that they scored a total of 720 points in their previous 24 games. Since they scored 313 fewer points in the championship game than they did in their previous games, we can set up the following equation:\n\n720 = x + 313\n\nSolving for x, we find that UF scored 720 points in their previous 24 games.

Multiplying the labor cost by the number of hours is the correct method because it gives us the total cost of the labor. Adding the hours first and then multiplying by the labor cost would not give us the total cost of the labor, because it would not take into account the number of hours required to complete the service or product.

Answer: 9 minutes\n\nExplanation: If Derek takes 9 minutes to walk a mile when he doesn't have to walk with his brother, and it takes him 12 minutes to walk a mile when he has to walk with his brother, it means that walking with his brother takes an additional 3 minutes.\nIn general, if it takes Derek x minutes to walk a mile when he doesn't have to walk with his brother, and it takes him y minutes to walk a mile when he does have to walk with his brother, it can be written as:\nx + 3 = y\n\nSubtracting 3 from both sides of this equation gives x = y - 3\n\nSo if it takes Derek y minutes to walk a mile with his brother, it takes him y - 3 minutes to walk a mile without his brother.
