So, Jeff completed (X + 1) + 4 skips.\n\nIn the last round, Jeff completed half the number of skips as Sam.

If the second gym is 3 times more expensive than the first gym, then the cost per month would be $10/month * 3 = $30 per month. Since the sign-up fee for the second gym is 4 months membership, John will have to pay $30/month * 4 months = $120 for the sign-up fee.

Since Mr. Callen cannot buy a fraction of a painting, the number of paintings he bought must be less than 6 but greater than or equal to 5.\n\nHence, Mr. Callen bought either 5 or 0 paintings from the crafts store.", "n_output": 396}

Let's say she spent x amount on Adidas. Therefore, she spent 3x on Nike sneakers.\n\n2. What she spent on Adidas was 1/5 the cost of Skechers. This means the amount she spent on Adidas is 1/5 of the amount she spent on Skechers. Let's say she spent y amount on Skechers. Therefore, the amount she spent on Adidas is y/5.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total amount she spent on athletic sneakers:\n\nMimi spent x on Adidas, 3x on Nike sneakers, and y on Skechers. So the total amount spent on athletic sneakers is x + 3x + y.\n\nAccording to the question, Mimi spent $8,000 on athletic sneakers and clothes. So we can set up the equation: x + 3x + y = 8000.\n\nWe also know that what she spent on Adidas is y/5. So we can set up another equation: x = y/5.\n\nNow we can substitute the value of x from the second equation into the first equation:\n(y/5) + 3(y/5) + y = 8000.\n\nCombining like terms, we get: 4(y/5) + y = 8000.\n\nMultiplying both sides by 5 to eliminate the fraction, we get: 4y + 5y = 40000.\n\nCombining like terms again, we get: 9y = 40000.\n\nDividing both sides by 9, we get: y = 40000/9.\n\nNow that we know the value of y, we can substitute it back into the second equation to find the value of x: x = (40000/9)/5.\n\nSimplifying, we get: x = 40000/45, or x = 888.89 (rounded to two decimal places).\n\nSo the total amount spent on athletic sneakers is x + 3x + y, which is 888.89 + 3(888.89) + 40000/9.\n\nCalculating this, we get: 2666.67 + 2666.67 + 4444.44 = $9777.78 (rounded to two decimal places).\n\nTherefore, Mimi spent approximately $9777.78 on athletic sneakers and clothes over the weekend.", "n_output": 509}

{"ground truth": 20.0, "prediction": "To find the discount percentage for the jeans on sale, we need to calculate the total discount amount and divide it by the full price of the jeans.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the discount amount from the sale. The jeans were on sale for 20% off, so the discount is 20% of $125:\nDiscount = 20% * $125 = 0.20 * $125 = $25\n\nNext, let's calculate the effective price after the sale discount. Subtract the discount amount from the full price:\nEffective Price = $125 - $25 = $100\n\nThen, Todd applied a coupon that took off an additional $10. Subtract this amount from the effective price:\nEffective Price after Coupon = $100 - $10 = $90\n\nFinally, Todd paid with a store credit card that gave him another 10% off the remaining amount. Calculate this discount by multiplying the effective price after the coupon by 10%:\nDiscount = 10% * $90 = 0.10 * $90 = $9\n\nNow, let's calculate the final price by subtracting the store credit card discount from the effective price after the coupon:\nFinal Price = $90 - $9 = $81\n\nTo find the discount percentage, divide the total discount amount by the full price of the jeans and multiply by 100:\nDiscount Percentage = (Total Discount / Full Price) * 100\nDiscount Percentage = ($25 / $125) * 100\nDiscount Percentage = 20%\n\nTherefore, the discount percentage for the jeans on sale is 20%.", "n_output": 318}

In this case, we have Maiya and her two sisters, so the average age is (M + 2M + (M - 1))/3.\n\nAccording to the problem, the average age is 5, so we have the equation (M + 2M + (M - 1))/3 = 5.\n\nWe can simplify the equation: (4M - 1)/3 = 5.\n\nNext, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 3 to get rid of the denominator: 4M - 1 = 15.\n\nNow, add 1 to both sides: 4M = 16.\n\nDivide both sides by 4: M = 4.\n\nTherefore, Maiya's age is 4.\n\nNow, let's find the age of the first sister: 2M = 2 * 4 = 8.\n\nThe average age is the sum of ages divided by the number of people: (4 + 8 + (4 - 1))/3 = 15/3 = 5.\n\nTherefore, the average age of Maiya and her two sisters is 5.", "n_output": 326}

Therefore, the group of athletes left the camp for a total of 112 athletes + 105 athletes = 217 athletes.\n\nTo determine the number of hours they left the camp for, we need to find how many hours it would take for 217 athletes to leave the camp at a rate of 28 athletes per hour.
