{"ground truth": 7.0, "prediction": "Question: Mark buys a loaf of bread for $4.20 and some cheese for $2.05. He gives the cashier $7.00. How much money does he give to the cashier? Answer: 5.15. Mark gives the cashier $5.15 for the loaf of bread and cheese he bought. 5.15 is 7.00-4.20, which is the equivalent of 1.85, which is 50 cents for the bread, and 50 cents for the cheese. 1.85 x 2 = 3.70, and 3.70 + 5.15 = 8.85. The total amount (1.85 + 5.15) = 7.00. Thus, Mark gives the cashier 7.00. This means that he gives the cashier 5.15 for the bread and 50 cents for the cheese. 3.70 + 50 cents = 5.15, and 5.15 + 7.00 = 12.15. The total amount (5.15) = 10.20.

Each spider he introduces eats 7 bugs, and each time he sprays the garden he reduces the total bug population to 80% of what it was previously. How many bugs does each spider he introduces eat? Answer: 1 spider per day, so one spider eats 1/7 of the bug population. Therefore, to reach 80% bug population reduction, Bill needs to introduce 4 spiders per day, or 15 in total.\nTo calculate percentage reduction, let 'n' be the number of bugs before the introduction of the spider. Then, the total number of bugs can be written as (7n - n) + (7n - n) = 14n - 2n = 14, where 14 is the total number of bugs. Therefore, the percentage reduction in bug population will be 14/7.

It still flows at 2 cups per 10 minutes for the next 30 minutes after. For the next hour, the water pressure maximizes to 4 cups per 10 minutes and stops. Shawn now has to dump half of the water away. What is the water flow rate of the sink? Answer: 2 cups per 10 minutes. The sink flow rate was 2 cups per 10 minutes for the first 30 minutes, then it increased to 4 cups per 10 minutes for the next 30 minutes and then it stopped. The sink is now in a steady state of 4 cups per 10 minutes and this rate can be maintained without any change. Any changes in the water flow will cause the flow rate to increase or decrease and the rate depends on the amount of water in the tank and the time it takes to fill it up. Therefore, the maximum rate of the sink is 4 cups per 10 minutes. For the time it's at it's maximum rate, it can discharge 4 cups of water in 10 minutes. So, for the last 10 minutes, it would be filling up 2 cups of water.

Later, his sister Piper comes home and takes 5 fewer bars than those taken in total by Thomas and his friends so she can also share with her friends. How many friends does Thomas have? Answer: 6. Thomas has 6 friends. 200 bars were divided into 140 bars for Thomas and his 4 friends.

For j = 1,2,3...n, define A(j) = (A(j))(A(j)) = 1 and B(j) = (B(j))(B(j)) = 1, where n is the number of columns in A and B.
