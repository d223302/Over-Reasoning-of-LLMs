How tall is the giant marble rectangular prism that John carves? Answer: 34 meters. Tips: The volume of the giant marble rectangular prism is: V = (2*8) * (2*2) = 68 kg/m3. The density of the marble is 2500 kg/m3, so the tower is 2700 kg/m3.

{"ground truth": 96.0, "prediction": "Question: Tim drops a ball off the roof of a 96-foot tall building. The ball bounces to half the height from which it fell on each bounce. How tall is the building from which Tim drops the ball? Answer: 48 feet. ---------------------------- *For each bounce, the ball rises to a height half the height (H half) of the building, where H is the height from which Tim drops the ball, so the height from which is 48. The rise is proportional between each bounce: for every bounce, the rise is a quarter of the previous rise, so it follows an exponential rise. The rise for the first bounce is 12, then 6, then 3, and so on. *So the rise for the nth bounce is 2 to the n. To calculate the total number of rises, the formula is n=log2 (H), so given is 48=log2 (H) and 48=H, so H=96. Therefore, the building is 96 feet tall."}

At the close of business she ended up making $50. As she went back through her inventory she noticed that she sold $11 worth of small lemonades and $24 worth of medium lemonades. How much worth of small lemonades did she sell? Answer: 11 The sales of small lemonades is equal to 11, which is the difference between the number of cups purchased and the number of cups remaining. The same strategy can be used to find the sales of medium lemonades, which is equal to 24.

For example, if a person jumps onto a trampoline, they will experience a sense of energy as they jump, and this energy comes from the trampoline as potential energy stored as elasticity. This is a transfer of energy from one form to another, and the energy is still active in the system. By the same token, when electrical energy is used to light a lightbulb, the electrical energy is converted into heat energy of the bulb and light energy, which is then transferred into the room or space. This conversion of energy from one form to another is not a violation of the law of conservation of energy. Energy can be neither created nor destroyed; it is simply converted from one form to another."}
