That means a discount of $90 * 10/100 = $9. So, the final price Todd paid was $90 - $9 = $81.\n\nNow, to calculate the total percentage discount, first calculate the total dollar amount of the discount, which is the original price minus the final price, $125 - $81 = $44.\n\nTo convert this to a percentage, divide the total discount by the original price and multiply by 100: ($44/$125) * 100 = 35.2%\n\nTherefore, the total discount percentage for the jeans on sale was approximately 35.2%.", "n_output": 226}

Hence the equation becomes:\n\nA = $10,000(1 + 0.20/1)^(1*3)\nA = $10,000(1.20)^3\nA = $10,000 * 1.728\nA = $17,280\n\nSo, Sam now has $17,280 after 3 years.\n\nHe then invested more until he had 3 times that invested. So his investment becomes $17,280 * 3 = $51,840\n\nThe next year, he earned a 15% return on his investment. His amount will increase by 15% of $51,840, which is $51,840 * 0.15 = $7,776.\n\nThe question asks for how much Sam invested, which would be the amount he had after first investment and additional investment, which totals to $51,840.", "n_output": 326}

{"ground truth": 4.0, "prediction": "First, we have to understand that the information given to us can be put into an algebraic equation. Let's denote:\n\nH = hamster's lifespan, \nB = bat's lifespan, \nF = frog's lifespan.\n\nBased on the problem, we get the following information:\n1. B = H + 6 (since a hamster lives 6 years less than a bat),\n2. F = 4H (since a frog lives 4 times as long as a hamster),\n3. H + B + F = 30 (altogether, these animals live for 30 years).\n\nNow let's substitute the first two equations into the third one. We substitute B by H + 6 and F by 4H. This way, we get:\n\nH + H + 6 + 4H = 30.\nThis simplifies to 6H + 6 = 30.\nSubtracting 6 from both sides of the equation, we get 6H = 24.\nFinally, we solve for H by dividing both sides by 6, so H = 4.\n\nSo, a hamster lives for 4 years, a bat lives for 4 + 6 = 10 years, and a frog lives for 4 x 4 = 16 years.\n\nThe lifespan ratio of a frog to a hamster is 16 to 4 or, simplified, 4:1.", "n_output": 291}

Therefore, the first tree is 420 - 240 = 180 rings older than the second tree.\n\nThe number of rings a tree grows per year can vary depending on the species and growing conditions, but a common method of determining a tree's age is by counting one ring for each year of growth. In this regional context, the trees grow 6 rings per year due to the weather fluctuations.", "n_output": 152}

This implies that they won approximately 1.63 times as many games in the fourth competition as they did in the first competition.", "n_output": 211}

According to the question, Han visited two less than twice as many as Jude, which we can write this mathematically as 2X - 2.\n\nJane visited 6 more than twice the number of centers as Han, which we can express as 2(2X - 2) + 6.\n\nAlso, we know that Jude visited half fewer rehabilitation centers as Lisa did, meaning Jude visited half as many as Lisa. So if Lisa visited Y centers, then Jude visited Y/2, and we can say X = Y/2.\n\nWe don't know how many centers Lisa visited, but we know that the same number is equal to Jane's 2(2X - 2) + 6 and Jude's X. We can set these equal to each other and solve for X.\n\nPlugging X = Y/2 into our equation: \n\n2[(2*(Y/2))-2]+6=Y,\nwhich simplifies to:\n2[Y-2]+6=Y,\nwhich simplifies further to:\n2Y-4+6=Y,\nwhich simplifies to:\n2Y+2=Y,\nwhich further simplifies to:\n2 = Y - 2Y,\nwhich simplifies to:\n2 = -Y,\nSo, \nY = -2.\n\nHowever, the number of visited centers cannot be negative, it seems like there's been a mistake. Let's reconsider our equations.\n\nLet's consider the statement \"Jude visited half fewer rehabilitation centers as Lisa did\", which means Jude visited half as many as Lisa. Let me correct a mistake I made interpreting this statement, indeed if Lisa visited Y centers, then Jude visited Y/2, which means that X = Y/2. \n\nLet's plug X = Y/2 into our equation again:\n\n2 *(2*(Y/2))-2 +6 = Y,\n\nwhich simplifies to:\n\nY - 2 + 6 = Y,\n\nthis simplifies further to:\n\nY+4 = Y  ---> This suggests a mistake again.\n\nReflecting on the statement \"Jude visited half fewer rehabilitation centers as Lisa did\" once more, it should mean that Jude visited HALF of what Lisa did NOT half as many - that's where the mistake is.\n\nSo, if Lisa visited Y centers, then Jude (X) visited Y - Y/2, which means X = Y - Y/2 = Y/2.\n\nLet's go again by plugging X = Y/2", "n_output": 512}

But since J should be a whole number, let's round it to 27.\n\nSo Jude sold approximately 27 tickets. Showing only whole numbers (since we can't sell partial tickets), Andrea would have sold 2 * 27 = 54 tickets, which leaves Sandra to have sold 100 - 27 - 54 = 19 tickets.\n\nSo, Sandra sold 19 - 27 = -8 tickets less than Jude.

So, the combined age of Jared and Hakimi would be 120 - 30 = 90 years.\n\nWe also know that Jared is 10 years older than Hakimi. If Hakimi's age is x years, then Jared's age would be x + 10 years. Therefore, (x + 10) + x = 90. Solving this equation gives x = 40.\n\nSo, Hakimi is 40 years old and Jared is 50 years old (40 + 10). \n\nTherefore, the total average age of the three friends remains as stated, which is 40 years old (120 total years / 3 people).", "n_output": 200}

We can represent this in mathematical equation as: \n\nX - 1/5*X - 1/4*X - $120 = $540\n\nTo solve this equation, we need to get rid of the fractions first. The least common multiple of 5 and 4 is 20, so we can multiply whole equation by 20:\n\n20X - 4*X - 5*X - 2400 = 10800\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n11X - 2400 = 10800\n\nSolve for X:\n\n11X = 10800 + 2400\n\n11X = 13200\n\nX = 13200 / 11\n\nX = $1200\n\nSo Susan originally had $1200.

{"ground truth": 3.0, "prediction": "Tom finishes the entire program, both BS and PhD, in 3/4 of the time it would normally take. \n\nUsually, it takes 3 years for BS and 5 years for Ph.D., which is a total of 8 years. This means Tom did it all in (3/4) * 8 = 6 years. \n\nThe BS portion of the degree is 3 out of the 8 years, so to find out how long Tom took for the BS in the same fraction of time, we use the rule of three or cross-multiplication.\n\nSo, Tom took (3/8) * 6 = 2.25 years. \n\nIf you want to express it as a fraction, assuming a year to be 12 months, 2.25 years equals 2 years and 3 months, which is 2 1/4 years, or 9/4 in year fractions. So Tom finishes the BS in 9/4ths the time it usually takes. However, if you mean by fraction of the normal course length he took, then it's 2.25/3 = 0.75, or 3/4 of the time it usually takes to finish the BS.", "n_output": 253}

Multiply the number of quarters and dimes by their respective values to find out the dollar amount each machine holds.\n\n(80 quarters * $0.25/quarter) + (100 dimes * $0.10/dime) = $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00\n\nTherefore, each machine holds $30.00.\n\nIf there are $90.00 in the launderette, we can divide this by the amount each machine holds to find out how many machines there are.\n\n$90.00 / $30.00/machine = 3 machines\n\nGiven that each machine holds the same number of quarters and dimes, the number of quarters would be divided equally among the machines. so, the number of quarters in every machine is:\n\n80 quarters / 3 machines =26.67 \n\nSince it's impossible to have a fraction of a coin, the answer must be rounded down to the nearest whole number, which is 26 quarters per machine. However, this also means that one of the machines must have had 27 quarters to reach the total of 80.
