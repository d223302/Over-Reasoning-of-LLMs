Answer: 236 dollars. 14 dollars is the amount left after buying 6 books at the cost of 236 dollars. Explanation: Fred had 236 dollars to spend on 6 books. Cost of each book = 236 dollars/6 books = 236 dollars/3 books. Therefore, Fred had 236 dollars to buy 3 books. After buying them, Fred had 14 dollars left. 14 dollars = 236 dollars/3 books. Therefore, 14 dollars is the amount left after buying 3 books. If Fred had 236 dollars to spend on 6 books, then the amount he had left after buying them is 14 dollars. This means that: 236 dollars = 14 dollars. Therefore, 236 dollars = 14 dollars. The equation of 3 = 14 and 236 dollar dollars = 14 dollar dollars is correct.\nEliminates\nSolution: The solution of the equation is 14 dollars = 14 dollars. 25 2\n90.5 2\n= 1"}

The company paved 4 miles of road on one day, then one mile less than double that on the second day. How many miles of road did the company pave on the first day? Answer: 4 miles. The company paved 4 miles of road on the first day. The second day, it paved one mile less than double that, or 4 miles.

Answer: Speed is a measure of how fast an object is moving in a straight line distance, while velocity, acceleration direction, and the magnitude. Speed is the average velocity of an object over a period of time. Velocity is the total velocity of an object over a period of time. Velocity is the time derivative of speed, and it is zero at any instantaneous speed (such), or the time rate of change of velocity. It is the only velocity related to speed which is directly measurable and can be expressed without distortion over a period of time. It is the rate of change of speed, while the rate of change of speed (the acceleration of velocity of an object) depends on the specific type of motion.

The first apartment costs $800 per month in rent and will cost an additional $260 per month in utilities. The second apartment costs $900 per month and will cost an additional $200 per month in utilities. The first apartment is slightly further from the man's work, and the man would have to drive 31 miles per day to get to work.

The man in the example is trying to maximize savings by comparing two apartments in terms of cost- utility cost, distance from work, and cost of utilities. He wishes to drive to work and is comparing distance, cost of utilities and mileage cost. He is looking to minimize the costs for the apartments and the distance he must drive to work. He must weigh the cost of the apartments, the distance from his work, and the cost of utilities in order to make the best financial decision. In addition, the cost of commuting to and from work must be considered in his analysis.  The IRS is not a defined entity definition; it is defined as 58 cents per mile.

Answer: 15 fewer fish.\nExercise: Factoring Quadratic Equations\nIf a quadratic equation is written in the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0, then the two terms ax^2 and bx can be considered as factors of the equation. (bx is not a true factor since it is the coefficients of the terms in the equation, not the terms themselves). This allows for the equation to be factored, ax^2 + bx = -cm, where -cm is a new, unnamed variable (we will refer to this as \"x - factor\" for clarity).\nTo factor the equation, substitute - cm to ax^2 + bx = -cm and the coefficient of the x^2 term is then ax^2 - bx. The x - factor term can then be eliminated by adding a variable of opposite sign (to opposite the coefficient sign of the original variable) to the left-hand side of the equation, leaving a linear equation to be solved."}

{"ground truth": 2.0, "prediction": "Question: Mike and Leo have to print as many pamphlets as possible for a social gathering. Mike manages to print as fast as 600 pamphlets per hour for 9 consecutive hours. After a break, he resumes the task for another 2 hours achieving a third of the speed he was doing before. Leo, on the other hand, only works a third as many hours as Mike did before his break, but was twice as fast as Mike before he took his break. How many hours did he spend on the task after the break? Answer: 4 hours. Reason: Mike printed 600 pamphlets per hour for 9 consecutive hours. During his break, his first hour was his rest hour and his last hour was double time. This means that he was 100% more efficient for 6 hours. Multiplying the 6 by two, equals 12. Hence, Leo spent 12 hours on the task, with a speed of 600 pamphlets per hour. This is still double the speed of Mike\u2019s before the break. However, Leo's speed is a third of Mike's, so he needs three times as many hours to do the same amount of pamphlets. Mike needs about 900 hours to print 48,000 pamphlets. Leo, therefore will print 100,400 in three hours.

{"ground truth": 4.0, "prediction": "Question: 24 gallons per second of water flows down a waterfall. If you have an empty basin that can hold 260 gallons of water. The basin leaks water at 4 gallons per second. How many gallons of water does the basin leak per second? Answer: 6 gallons of water. This is calculated by using the equation: gpm = ------ x gpm. The ------ is the percentage of the rate, in this case 24 gallons per second. 4 gallons per second is 0.1667, the percentage multiplied by itself equals 24 and that is why it is equal to -4, it will be negative multiplied by itself.

Calculate the percentage change in price of a good from 1913 to 2013. Answer: The increase in price of the good from 1913 to 2013 was approximately 100%.
