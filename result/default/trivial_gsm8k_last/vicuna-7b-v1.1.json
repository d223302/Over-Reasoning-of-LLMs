On average, dogs live 4 times as long as hamsters live. And hamsters live an average of 2.5 years. What is the average lifespan of hamsters? Answer: 2.5 years.

Also, the synopsis didn't particularly grab me. However, I ended up enjoying it more than I thought I would.\nI loved the way the story is told through journal entries, letters and interviews, which works well for this kind of book. I also liked the way the characters are quite layered and not all what they appear to be at first. The relationship between Alice and Nathan is well done, with some unexpected moments.\nThe book does take a while to get going, but the last 40 pages or so are quite good indeed. The ending is a bit abrupt, but it seems to fit the story. I think fans of Elizabeth Kostova would probably enjoy this one. I look forward to future works from this author.", "n_output": -1}

Therefore, the number of jellybeans that Rory has is 30. The number of jellybeans that both Gigi and Rory have is 15 + 30 = 45.

What was the age difference between Viggo and his younger brother when his brother was 2? Answer: 10. Let x be the age of Viggo's younger brother when he was 2 years old. \ufffd\ufffd x 2 = 10 (1) Now, we'll use x = 2 to find the initial difference in their ages. 7. Hence, x = 2 and x = 10 and we have x = 2 and x = 10, 7. But this does not satisfy the problem statement, which demands the greater and two x's are the younger brother's age when Viggo's younger brother was 2 and x is the age of Viggo's younger brother when x is 2. This implies that x cannot be 7, so the x in line 4 cannot be 7. It must be 10. We also know that x = 2, as the problem states that Viggo is twice as old as his younger brother. Therefore, the x in line 7 is x = 2, not 7. We can also write out the problem to see that the age difference between Viggo and his younger brother is 7 when his younger brother was 2. At this time, Viggo would be twice as old as his younger brother, so Viggo would be 10 years older. Thus, the question is asking for x, which is the age difference between Viggo and his younger brother in 7, when his younger brother was 2. The answer is 10, which matches our original equation in equation equation equation Let's older brother's age.", "n_output": -1}

The first time she drank from it, she consumed a quarter of the water in the bottle. Later on, she drank 2/3rd of the remaining water. How much of the remaining water did she drink? Answer: 3/4 of the remaining water.\nAnswer: 3/4 of the remaining water. This problem is a 4th grade reading comprehension question that asks the reader to solve a percentage decrease problem. When you drink a quarter of a full, it means that you drink 1/4 of the total amount. When you drink 2/3rds of the remaining water after drinking a quarter of the full, it means that you drink 2/3 of all the remaining water that is left after you drank the quarter of the full. So the total amount of water remaining after drinking a quarter of the full is 4 liters x 3/4 = 3 liters. Then you drink 2/3 of the remaining water after drinking a quarter of the full, which means that you drink 2/3 x 3 liters = 3 liters as well. Answer Total remaining amount of water is 6 liters. Then you drink 2/3 liters of the remaining water, so the amount of water remaining is now 6 liters - 2/3 liters = 4 liters. Q: Which is the largest angle in a pentagon?

Three times that number finish in less than 8 minutes. 1/6 of the remaining kids take more than 14 minutes. What fraction of the remaining kids take more than 14 minutes? Answer: 1/4. Why is that? Take the 40 kids that did not pass the finish line in less than 6 minutes. Let's call them group A. Than take the remaining 480 kids that finished in less than 8 minutes. Let's call them group B. The 10% of group A that passed in less than 6 minutes is 40/100 \\* 100% = 40/100 \\* 400/1000 = 40x60. The 3x of group B that passed in less than 8 minutes is 3x \\* 8 = 24. The ratio 609=40x60:8. 24:40x60. Let's say the ratio of group B is 8:24. Multiply 40x60 by 8 to get 3360. Add 3360+24 to get a total of 3604. Divide 3604 by 24 to get 1505.

Answer: 15 rounds.\nSolution:\nLet's first set up the equation we have to solve:\nTaro's total points = 3/5 of the total points scored\nTaro's total points = (5n-4)/5\nNow, we need to find out how many points Taro's opponent (let's call him Vlad) scored. We know that Vlad scored 3n points because Taro lost 4 points.\nTo find out how many points Vlad scored, we can combine these two equations:\n3n = 5n-4\n3n = (5n-4)\nNow, let's solve this system of two equations:\n3n-4 = 5n-4\n3n = 5n\nn = 5\nSo, Vlad scored 5 points per round.

Every morning, around 8 a.m., Ms. Mosel goes to collect the eggs because, every morning, each hen lays one. Then, after 1 hour of collection, she puts all these eggs in boxes of 6. It takes her another 40 minutes. Once all this is done, Ms. Mosel brings all the boxes of eggs to her village. She does it from Monday to Sunday, because chickens don't have a day off. How long does it take her? Answer: 3 hours.\nLet x be the number of minutes it takes to collect, pack, and carry all the eggs.\nMs. Mosel spends x/7 hours collecting eggs, packing them into boxes of 6, and carrying the boxes.\nSince each hen lays one egg every morning, she collects a total of 270*x/7 = 73 x 12 = 912 eggs, and she packs them into 73 boxes of 6.\nIt takes her x/7 hours to do this.\nShe spends another 40 minutes carrying the boxes, but she does this every morning, so she carries a total of 73 boxes every week. Since a week has 400 minutes (7 x 60), it follows that she carries the boxes for a total of (73/400) = 0.185 = 18.5% of the time.\nNow we can find x/7 hours by dividing the time by the number of eggs boxes she carries. Since she carries 73 boxes every week, she carries a total of 73 x V/7, where V is the volume of the boxes. Since each box has a volume of 0.1 cubic cubic measure (cub), V = 0.1 cubic cub measure(c) of measure, so 73 x 0.185 = 13.3 cubic measure(s of measure. Since each box measures 0.185 cubic feet of volume, the volume of each box of the boxes is 73 x 13.3 = 95.2 cubed cubes3 cubs.

Answer: 10 people didn\n\nMath (percentages):\nLet X = the number of people who showed up and D = the number of people who didn't get a gift.\nWe know that 90% of the people who received an invitation replied. This is equivalent to 90/100 \\* X = 90X.\nAnd since 80% of the people who replied actually showed up. This is 80/100 \\* X = 80X.\nWe also know that 10 people who showed up didn't get a gift.

There are 25 students in the class. One student is absent and has to take the test the next day. The average score of the students who took the test was 77%. What was the average score of the students who took the test? Answer: 77%.\nExplanation: If the average score on the test was 77%, then this means that the sum of the scores of the students who took the test is equal to 77/25 = 3.16.\nSince 77% is equal to the average score, it means that the average score must be exactly 77/25 + 1/25 = 81/25. But since there is one student who took the test the next day, the average score must be reduced by half to account for the fact that one student was not present when the test was taken. So, the average score of the students who took the test was 81/25 = 3.20. Since Ms. Mitsuko only considers the average score to be 77%, this means that she only counts the scores of the students who took the test when she made her announcement.\n, so the final answer is 77%.

Answer: 1/2 Grace's age in the question is not explicitly stated, so we cannot determine the fraction of her grandmother's age Grace's age is by finding the ratio of Grace's age to her grandmother's age. The given information is that Grace's age is 3/8th the age of her grandmother and her grandmother is twice the age of Grace's mother. From this we can write the equation Grace's age = 3/8 x her grandmother's age and her grandmother's age = 2 \\* her mother's age.
