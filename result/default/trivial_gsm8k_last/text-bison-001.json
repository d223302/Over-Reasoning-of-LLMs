If Sandra sold 4 more than half the number of tickets Jude sold, then Sandra sold 1 / 2 * Jude's number of tickets + 4 tickets. Substituting these values into the equation 2 * Jude's number of tickets + Sandra's number of tickets = 100 tickets, we can solve for the number of tickets Jude sold. 2 * Jude's number of tickets + 1 / 2 * Jude's number of tickets + 4 = 100 tickets 3 / 2 * Jude's number of tickets = 100 tickets Jude's number of tickets = 100 tickets * 2 / 3 = 67 tickets.

If 5(amount from previous painting) - 1000 is five times more than the amount from his previous painting, then it is 5(amount from previous painting) - 1000 = 5(amount from previous painting). Substituting in 5(amount from previous painting) - 1000 for 5(amount from previous painting), the expression simplifies to 5(amount from previous painting) - 1000 = 5(amount from previous painting) - 1000. Adding 1000 to both sides of the equation, the expression simplifies to 5(amount from previous painting) = 5(amount from previous painting) + 1000.
