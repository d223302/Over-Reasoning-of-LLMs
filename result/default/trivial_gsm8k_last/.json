{"ground truth": 2.5, "prediction": "Question: At the new store, there are 3 times as many grape candies as cherry candies, and 2 times as many apple candies as grape candies. All the candies cost $2.50 each. What is the cost of each candy? Answer: 20 cents for grape, 15 cents for cherry, 10 cents for apple.\nLet X represent the number of grape candies, Y the number of cherry candies, and Z the number of apple candies. We can write the equation as X=1.5Y+0.2Z. Plugging in different numbers, we can find out the cost of each candy is given by: 25X = 35Y + 30Z, which simplifies to 10X = 30Y + 15Z. Since X, Y, and Z all have the same value, we can divide both sides of the equation by 10 and solve for the cost of each type of candy. The cost of grape candy is 5X, the cost of cherry candy is 4X, and the cost of apple candy is 3X. Therefore, the cost of each candy is 20 cents for grape, 15 cents for cherry and 10 cents for apple."}
