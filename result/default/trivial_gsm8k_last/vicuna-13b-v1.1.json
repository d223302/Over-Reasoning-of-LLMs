There are only 25% as many green flowers as there are yellow and purple flowers. What percentage of green flowers are there compared to yellow and purple flowers? Answer: 25/(25+80) = 25/105 = 25/4ths = 1/15.\n\nProblem:\n\nMark has 45 yellow flowers, and 70% more of those in purple than in yellow. He has 15 green flowers and there are 15/10 times more purple flowers than green ones. Find the number of yellow flowers.\n\nSolution:\n\nLet x be the number of yellow flowers.\n\nFrom the problem, we know that Mark has 70/100 \\* x = 70% more yellow flowers than purple ones. So there are 70/100x yellow flowers.\n\nSimilarly, purple flowers are 150/100x/2 = 75% more than yellow flowers. So 5x/2 = 150/100x/2 = 75%.\n\nSo, the number of yellow flowers is 70/(0.75x) = 70/0.75x.\n\nLet y be the number of purple flowers. Then we know that 15 = 150/100x/2 = (3/2)x/2.\n\nSubstituting x in terms of y in the equation for yellow and purple flowers we get 22.5x = 225.\n\nTherefore, x = 225/22.5 = 10.\n\nSo, the number of yellow flowers is 70/10.\n\nTherefore, there are 70/10 yellow flowers and 10 green flowers.

Answer: 16.\n\nThis problem is an example of a **riddle**. It's a type of puzzle that involves a paradox or a contradiction. The solution to the puzzle often involves a logical fallacy.\n\nIn this example, the problem is a mathematical contradiction. The first part of the problem says that Lee mowed 1 lawn and received $33. The second part of the problem says that Lee mowed 16 lawns and received $33. These two parts of the problem are contradictory: if Lee mowed only 1 lawn, he would not have received $33. If he mowed 16 lawns, he would not have received $33.\n\nTo solve this problem, you need to determine whether Lee mowed 1 or 16 lawns. Then you can calculate the total number of lawns he mowed and the total amount of money he received.\n\n**Solution:**\n\nIf Lee mowed 1 lawn, he would have received $33, but if he mowed 16 lawns, he would have received $49 ($33 per lawn x 16 lawns). Since the problem states that Lee received $33, it must be that he mowed 1 lawn.\n\nThus, the solution is that Lee mowed 1 lawn and received $33.\n\nIn summary, the solution to this problem is to determine the number of lawns lawns mowed mowed and calculate amount of money received.", "n_output": -1}

{"ground truth": 30.0, "prediction": "Question: Tim has 30 less apples than Martha, and Harry has half as many apples as Tim. How many less apples does Tim have than Martha? Answer: 30 - 30 = 0. This is a special case of a general pattern. If you have x fewer apples than someone with n apples, and you have half as many apples as someone with x apples, then you have x - n = 0. This means that you have n - x apples, or n - x = n - x = 0. This is a very interesting pattern, because it means that you can make up any number of apples by taking away the same number of apples from two different people. For example, if you have 10 apples and Martha has 15 apples, you can take away 5 apples from both of you to make up the missing 5 apples.\n\n### Example\n\nIn this example, we prove that the pattern is true by considering the three different cases.\n\n#### Case 1\n\nSuppose Tim has 0 apples and Martha has 10 apples. In this case, Harry has 5 apples (half as many as Tim) and has 5 fewer apples than Tim (30-5=25).\n\n#### Case 2\n\nSuppose Tim has 1 apple and Martha has 2 apples. In this case, Harry has 0.5 apples (half as many as Tim) and has 1 fewer apple than Tim (25-1=24).\n\n#### Case 3\n\nSuppose Tim has 5 apples and Martha has 7 apples. In this case, Harry has 2.5 apples (half as many as Tim) and has 2 fewer apples than Tim (24-2=22). Since the difference between the number of apples of Tim and Harry is always 2, they Harry can make it up by taking 2 apples away from him.\n\nConclusion:\nThis pattern shows that the statement is true true.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis theorem theorem shows that the pattern pattern is true.

{"ground truth": 4.0, "prediction": "Question: Paityn has 20 red hats and 24 blue hats. Her friend Zola has 4/5 times as many red hats as she has and twice the number of blue hats. How many times as many red hats does Zola have compared to her? Answer: 4/5\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn order to determine how many times as many red hats Zola has compared to Paityn, we need to determine the total number of red hats that Zola has. We can do this by multiplying Paityn's number of red hats by 4/5. This gives us 20 red hats \\* 4/5 = 8 red hats.\n\nSince Zola has 4/5 times as many red hats as Paityn, this means that she has 8 red hats + 24 blue hats = 32 hats in total. This is twice the number of blue hats that Paityn has, so we can say that Zola has twice as many blue hats as Paityn as well.\n\nTherefore, Zola has 8 red hats / 8 = 1 red hat for every 8 blue hats she has. This means she has 8/1 times as many red hats as Paityn, which can be simplified to 8 times. Therefore, Zola has 8 times as many red hats compared to Paityn.", "n_output": -1}

{"ground truth": 36.0, "prediction": "Question: A craft store makes a third of its sales in the fabric section, a quarter of its sales in the jewelry section, and the rest in the stationery section. They made 36 sales today. How many sales did they make today? Answer: 12\n\nAnswer explanation: To solve this problem, we need to set up two equations that represent the number of sales made in the fabric, jewelry, and stationery sections. We can then solve for the number of sales made in each section given the total number of sales.\n\nLet F be the number of sales made in the fabric section, J be the number of sales made in the jewelry section, and S be the number of sales made in the stationery section. Then we can set up the two equations:\n\n* 1/3 * F = S\n* 1/4 * J + (1/3) \\* F = S\n\nWe want to solve for S, the total number of sales. In the second equation, we can simplify and solve for S as follows:\n\n* 1/4 \\* J + (1/3) \\* F = S\n* (3/4) \\* J + 1/3 \\* F = S\n* 4/7 \\* J + 1/7 \\* F = S\n* 5/7 \\* J = S - 1/7 \\* F\n* S = (7/5) \\* J - (1/5) \\* F\n\nSubstituting the second equation back into the first equation, we get:\n\n* 1/3 \\* F = (7/5) \\* J - (1/5) \\* F\n* 7/5 \\* J - 3/5 \\* F = 0\n\nSolving this system of linear equations, we get:\n\n* F = 24\n* J = 48\n* S = 24\n\nTherefore, the craft store made 24 sales in the fabric section, 48 sales in the jewelry section, and 24 sales in the stationery section for a total of 36 sales today.

{"ground truth": 90.0, "prediction": "Question: Borris liquor store uses 90 kilograms of grapes every 6 months. He is thinking of increasing his production by twenty percent. How many kilograms of grapes does Borris liquor store use every 6 months? Answer: 110 kilograms. He is increasing his production from 90 to 110, which is a 20% increase.\n\nQuestion: How much did the value of the yuan increase? Answer: The value of the yuan increased by 20%.\n\nThere are two things wrong with these statements. First, they fail to specify over what period of time the increase is to take place. It is essential in such questions to specify the time period over which the increase is to take place, since the rate of increase can vary depending on the time frame.\n\nSecondly, these statements do not provide any information about what the starting point or base was, which is necessary to compute the percentage increase or decrease. Without knowing the starting point, it is impossible to determine the exact amount of increase or decrease that took place.\n\nSuppose Borris Liquor store started using 90 kilograms of grapes 6 months ago, and we want to know how much his production increased over that time frame. We cannot simply state that he used 110 kilograms of grapes last month to make his liquor. It may be that he used much more or much less than 110 kilograms last month, and the 20% increase we are trying to compute is based on the amount used last month versus the starting point.\n\nIn general, a good way to formulate a question measuring the size or change of an increase or decrease is to specify the time frame period time frame time frame and the starting point point. For example, \u201cWhat was the daily daily daily increase in the price of oil from the to the the of months? The time frame time period is March 2012 to March 2013. The starting point point is the price of oil in March 2012, which is $38.40 per barrel. To determine the amount of increase, we can subtract the starting point from the point value: $$$38.40 \\* (38.40/38.40) = 38.40$$ In this example, the amount of increase is 38.40$, which is the difference between the starting point and the point value in March 2013. This is a 20% increase from the starting point.", "n_output": -1}

The other half eat 1/2 a roll each. How many rolls does each person eat? Answer: 1 1/2 rolls.\n\nProblem statement:\n\nGiven a group of 16 people and 40 dinner rolls, 8 of the people will each eat 1 1/2 rolls and the other 8 will each eat 1/2 a roll. This is a classic problem of partitioning a group into two equal parts based on some property.\n\nOne way to determine how many rolls each person eats is to calculate how many people can be seated at two tables of 8 people each, and then have each table's people each receive 1 1/2 rolls. The remainder of the people can then be divided among the two tables, each receiving 1/2 rolls.\n\nSolution:\n\nTo divide the 16 people into two tables of 8 people each, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Start with the first two people. They must sit at table 1.\n2. Next, we add the next two people to table 1 or table 2. If the total number of people at table 1 is already at 6, we must switch them to table 2 and add 2 more people to table 1.\n3. Repeat steps 2 and 2 until both tables have 8 people each.\n\nThe table configuration is identical for both tables.\n\n\nNow, we have two tables of 8 people each. We need to give each person at each table 1 1 1/2 rolls and each person at each table 2 1/2 a roll.\n\nAt table 1, there are 8 people, so 8 \\* 1 1/2 rolls = 6 1/2 rolls. This leaves 40 - 6 1/2 rolls for the second table.\n\nAt table 2, there are also 8 people, so 8 \\* 1/2 rolls = 4 1/2 rolls. This leaves 40 - 4 1/2 rolls for the first table.\n\nWe can divide the remaining 4 1/2 rolls in the first table among the last four people so that each person receives 1/2 a roll.\n\nThus, each person at the dinner party eats 1 1/2 rolls.\n\nConclusion", "n_output": -1}

{"ground truth": 10.0, "prediction": "Question: Randy just turned 12 and started playing the piano. His friend Sheila told him about the 10,000-hour rule which says, after 10,000 hours of practice, you become an expert or master in your field. How many hours of practice does it take to become an expert or master in your field according to the 10,000-hour rule? Answer: 10,000 hours.\n\nExplanation:\nThe 10,000-hour rule is a theory proposed by Malcolm Gladwell in his book \"Outliers.\" It is based on the idea that success is not just dependent on innate ability, but also on the amount of time and effort put into mastering a particular skill or discipline.\nIn other words, the 10,000-hour rule suggests that one needs to put in around 10,000 hours of deliberate practice to become an expert or master in any given field.\n\nHowever, it's also important to note that the 10,000-hour rule is not a hard and fast rule, and that people can become experts or masters in their field with less than 10,000 hours of practice or more than 10,000 hours of practice. Additionally, it's not only about the hours you put in, but also how you put them in. It's important to have a clear goal, structured practicing plan and a well-crafted path of progression to reach the desired level of mastery.\n\nExample:\nIt takes 10000 hours of practice to become a Chess Master or a Grand Master in chess, but different field have different time frames. For example, a pro-athlete in marathon may need less hours of practice to become an expert at their field, due to natural physical giftings.\n\nReference:\n\"Outliers: The Story of Success\" by Malcolm Gladwell.", "n_output": -1}

What fraction of that does she give to a friend? Answer: 1/4. \ud83e\udd14\n\nHere's a possible solution:\n\nLet's assume that the 1000 feet of cable is represented by the variable C.\n\nFrom the question, we know that Jan splits up the cable into 25-foot sections, which means she forms 25 sections from the cable. Let's represent these sections with the variable s. Therefore, s = 25.\n\nNext, Jan gives 1/4 of one of these sections to a friend, which means she gives the friend a 1/4-th of one section, represented by variable q. Therefore, q = 1/4\\*s.\n\nSince Jan gives 1/4 of one section to her friend, that means she keeps 3/4 of it for herself. So, she has 3/4\\*s sections from the cable.\n\nFinally, Jan puts half of the rest of the cable in storage. That means she puts 1/2\\*s section in storage.\n\nSince Jan gives 1/4 of one section to her friend and puts 1/2 of the rest in storage, we can express the fraction of the total cable she gives to her friend as:\n\n(3/4\\*s + 1/2)/C\n\nSimplifying the expression, we get:\n\n3/4s + 1/2\n\nNote that this fraction is equivalent to the initial expression representing Jan's action:\n\n3/4s + 1/2 = 3/4s + 1/2 = 32/4\n\nTherefore, Jan gives her friend 32/4 or 7/4 feet of cable.", "n_output": -1}

{"ground truth": 5.0, "prediction": "Question: Every hour past noon shadows from a building stretch an extra 5 feet, starting at zero at noon. How much do the shadows from the building stretch every hour past noon? Answer: 5 feet.\n\nExplanation: The problem states that the shadows from a building stretch an extra 5 feet for every hour past noon. This means that at noon, the shadow is 0 feet longer than it would be if it were cast at any other time of the day. At any other time, the shadow would be the same length as it would be at noon.\n\nLet's call the extra length of the shadow at a given time \"x\" feet. Since the shadow is longer at noon than it is at other times, this means that:\n\n0 = x + the length of the shadow at noon\n\nSince the length of the shadow at noon is the same as at any other time, we can simplify this equation to:\n\nx + the length of the shadow at noon = x\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = 0\n\nThis means that the extra length of the shadow at any given time is 0 feet, or in other words, the shadow is the same length at every hour past noon.", "n_output": -1}

How many times as many Buicks does Jim have compared to Fords? Answer: 4/3.\n\nConcept: In this problem, Jim has 4 times as many Buicks as Fords. This means that the number of Buicks, which is 4 units, can be expressed as a ratio of 4 to 1. To find the ratio of Buicks to Fords, we simply divide the number of Buicks by the number of Fords. Therefore, the ratio of Jim's Buicks to Fords is 4/3.\n\nSolution: As mentioned above, the ratio of Jim's Buicks to Fords is 4/3. To solve this problem, we can set up a proportion using this ratio. Let x be the number of Fords and y be the number of Buicks. We know that 4x = 3y, so we can solve for y by dividing both sides of the equation by 4.\n\ny = 4x/3\n\nWe can substitute this equation into the original equation. 4x = 3y, so 4x = 3(4x/3), which means 4x = 12x/3.\n\nSolving for x, we can see that x = 3 is a solution solution solution solution solution solution solution solution.\n\n\nTherefore, the solution Jim has 3 more than twice the number of Fords than Chevys.", "n_output": -1}

{"ground truth": 4.0, "prediction": "Question: Chelsea has 24 kilos of sugar. She divides them into 4 bags equally. Then one of the bags gets torn and half of the sugar falls to the ground. How many bags does she divide them into? Answer: 4\n\nThis question is intended to challenge a student's understanding of the concept of division.\n\nAs we can see in the text, the question is asking to divide the 24 kilos of sugar into 4 bundles, so each bundle contains 24 / 4 = 6 kilos of sugar. This is the correct answer to the question. Each of the 4 bags would contain 6 kilos of sugar and the total amount of sugar would be 6 x 4 = 24 kilos. In the last part of the question, Chelsea has 24 kilos of sugar, and 1 of the 4 bags gets torn and half of the sugar falls to the ground. But the question is only asking for the number of bags she divide them into, not the total amount of sugar. Hence, the answer is 4.", "n_output": -1}

They wanted to buy small American flags for everyone. The craft store was having a sale on small flags, 5 flags for $1.00. How many flags were on sale for $1.00 at the craft store? Answer: 140 flags.\n\nExplanation: We can set up a system of equations based on the information given in the problem. Let x be the number of flags that Jay invited and y be the number of flags that Gloria invited. We know that x + y = 68, the total number of people invited. Therefore, we can set up the following system of equations:\n\nx + y = 68\n\nWe also know that x = 22 and y = 36 from the problem statement. Substituting these values into the first equation, we get:\n\n22 + 36 = 68\n\nNow we can solve the system of equations:\n\n22 + 36 = 68\n\n36 = 68 - 22\n\ny = 68 - 22\n\nSubstituting y = 68 - 22 into the equation x + y = 68 , we get:\n\n22 + (68 - 22) = 68\n\n22 + 46 = 68\n\nx + (36) = 68\n\nx + 36 = 68\n\nx = 32\n\nTherefore, Jay invited 32 people and Gloria invited 36 people to the party.

Explanation: To find the total number of cars and motorcycles, we use the formulas to find the number of cars and the number of motorcycles. There are 8 cars because a quarter of the cars have a spare tire included, and since there are 24 total cars and motorcycles, that means there are 24/4=6 cars with spare tires. There are also 8 motorcycles because a third of the vehicles are motorcycles, and since there are 24 total cars and motorcycles, that means there are 24/3=8 motorcycles.

This means that each person would get 1/2 of a dozen doughnuts, or 1/2 \\* 2 = 1 doughnut. Since each person was getting 1 doughnut, that means that 8 people were going to share 8/1 = 8 doughnuts. Since each person was getting 1/8 of a dozen doughnuts, that means that 8 people were going to share 8/8 = 1 dozen doughnuts. Since each person was getting 1/4 of one dozen doughnuts, that means that 8 people were going to share 1/4 \\* 8 = 2 dozen doughnuts, and this is the same as the question 8.", "n_output": -1}

So, the farmer has 2x cows and 2x + 4 cows, which is equal to 2(x + 2) cows. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x + 2 = 1, which has only one solution of x = 1.

There are 36 weeks of school and Jackson has only missed 1 Wednesday and 2 Fridays. How many weeks of school are there? Answer: 29 weeks of school.\nExplanation: There are 36 weeks of school, and Jackson has only missed 1 Wednesday and 2 Fridays. Since he missed only 1 Wednesday, that means there are 36 \u2013 1 = 35 weeks of school. Similarly, since he missed only 2 Fridays, that means there are 36 \u2013 2 = 34 weeks of school. Adding the two together gives us 35 + 34 = 69 weeks of school. Since there are only 36 weeks of school in total, this means that Jackson missed 36 \u2013 69 = 0 weeks of school. So, there are 29 weeks of school in total.\nQuestion: A library has 4 walls and 2 windows. Each wall is 4 feet long and each window is 2 feet wide.

{"ground truth": 1.5, "prediction": "Question: James buys 3 CDs. Two of them are 1.5 hours each. The last one is twice that long. How long is each of them? Answer: 0.5 hours.\n\nI am assuming that your question is a mathematical puzzle. If this is not the case, please let me know.\n\nFirst, we can determine the total duration of the CDs by adding the times of each CD. We can do this as follows:\n* The first CD is 1.5 hours long.\n* The second CD is also 1.5 hours long, so its duration is the same as the first CD.\n* The third CD is twice as long as the second CD, so it is 3 hours long.\n* Therefore, the total duration of the CDs is 1.5 + 1.5 + 3 = 6 hours.\n\nNow we can use the information about the total duration to determine the length of each CD. Since the total duration is 6 hours and there are only 3 CDs, each CD must be the duration of 6 hours / 3 CDs = <<6/3=2>>2 hours.\n\nSince the third CD is twice as long as the second CD, the second CD is also 2 hours long. And since the second CD is the same duration as the first CD, we can say that the first CD is also 2 hours long.\n\nFinally, we can use the fact that each CD is 2 hours long to determine the length of each CD.\n* The first CD lasts for 2/24 of a day, which is 1/24 of a day.\n* The second CD lasts for the same amount of time as the first CD, which is 1/24 of a day.\n* The third CD lasts for 3 times as long as the second CD, which is 3\\* (1/24 of a day) = 3/24 of a day.\n\nTherefore, each CD lasts for 1/24 of a day, and each CD is 1/4 an hour long.\n\nI hope this explanation helps!", "n_output": -1}

{"ground truth": 20.0, "prediction": "Question: John decides to learn how to play the piano. He buys a piano for $500. He then hires a teacher for 20 lessons at $40 per lesson but ends up getting a 25% discount. How many lessons did he hire a teacher for? Answer: 20 lessons\n\nAnswer: 20 lessons.\n\nExplanation:\nFirst find the discount as a decimal: 20%/100=0.2\nThen multiply the cost of the piano by the discount to find the discounted cost: 500\\*0.2=100\nThen subtract the discounted cost from the original cost to find the number of lessons hired: 500-100=400\nThen divide the number of lessons hired by the original cost to find the number of lessons hired per dollar: 400/500=0.8\nFinally, divide the number of lessons hired per dollar by the number of lessons the teacher was hired for to get the number of lessons the teacher was hired for: 0.8/20=0.04\nSince the teacher was hired for 20 lessons, the number of lessons the teacher was hired for is 40.\n\nThis solution is incorrect, as it does not account for the 25% discount. If lessons were hired at the discounted cost of $100, only 2 more lessons were hired than expected, a total of 22 lessons would be taken.\n\nAnother strategy would be to divide the complete cost of lessons by the cost of the piano to find the number of lessons per dollar. If the complete cost of lessons was $400 and the cost of the piano was $500, the total cost of the lessons was $500. Divide the complete cost of the lessons by the cost of the piano to find the number of lessons per dollar: $500/500=1.\nDivide the number of lessons per dollar by the number of lessons expected to find the number of extra lessons: 1/20=0.05.\nAnswer: 22 lessons (rounded to the nearest whole number).", "n_output": -1}

The towels take twice as long as the clothes to wash. The sheets take 15 minutes less time to wash than the towels. How much less time do the sheets take to wash than the towels? Answer: 15 minutes\n\nExplanation:\nLet x be the amount of time it takes to wash the towels and y be the amount of time it takes to wash the sheets.\n\nAccording to the problem statement, we know that x + y = 30 (the total time it takes to wash all the items) and that y = 2x/3 (the ratio of towels to clothes)\n\nSetting up equations helps us solve this problem:\nx + y = 30 (1)\ny = 2x/3\n\nWe want to find the difference in time between towels and sheets, so we need to find y when x = 0 (since x represents the time for towels and y represents the time for sheets/blankets, if x is zero, the difference in time between towels and sheets would be 0).\n\nSubstituting y = 2x/3 in equation (1)\nwe get x + (2/3)x = 30\nSimplifying it\nx = 5/6\n\nSo, y = 2x/3 = 2(5/6) = 10/6 which is 15 minutes less than x.\n\nAnswer: \\box{15}.", "n_output": -1}

The third day she lays 20 more than the second day, and the last day she doubles the first three days total. How many more eggs does she lay on the third day compared to the second day? Answer: 10\n\nI have solved it like this:\n50 + (50\\*2) + (50\\*2+20) + (50*2*3) = 220\nAnd since the third day is 10 more than the second day, the equation 220 - 210 = 10 holds true.\nBut the answer is not correct.\nWhat am I doing wrong?\n\nAnswer:\nOn the third day, the frog lays 50 more eggs than on the second day. Therefore, the third day's egg production is 50 eggs more than the second day. The third day's egg production is (50 + 20) = 70 eggs.\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (B).\n\nCan someone explain to me why my approach is wrong?\n\nAlso, I am trying to understand the logic behind this question. How do I go about solving questions like this in the future?\n\nThank you!\n\nComment: Hi. Your approach is not wrong, but it may be a little bit hard to understand for some people. The important thing thing here is that you understand the problem before you start solving it. If you you understand that the that the frog is laying more than one double more eggs on the third than on the second day, then you will understand that the equation 220 - 210 = 10 is not correct correct. I would recommended you try try try to try to explain the problem in more more simpler way, this will will help help you understand understand the problem better.\n\n\nComment: Here is one example approach:\nSuppose the frog lays eggs on the first day. Then, she lays eggs on the second day (which is equal to the first day), and on the third day, she lays 20 more eggs than on the second day. Therefore, the total number of eggs she lays on the third day is  (number of eggs she lays on the first day) + 20 + (number of eggs she lays on the second day) + (number of eggs she lays on the third day) = eggs.\nSo, she lays 50 + 20 + 70 + 70 = 150 eggs on the third day.\n\nAnswer: The f", "n_output": -1}

Shirley was able to complete twice as many math questions within that same time, and Kiana completed half of the sum of Fiona and Shirley's math questions. How many math questions did Fiona complete in an hour? Answer: 144. Explanation: Since Shirley was able to complete twice as many math questions as Fiona, that means Fiona completed 36/2 = <<36/2=18>>18 math questions in an hour.\nSince Kiana completed half of the sum of Fiona and Shirley's math questions, that means she completed 36+18=54 questions.\nTherefore, Fiona completed 18 out of the 54 questions, and since every question was answered by either Fiona, Shirley, or Kiana, the total number of questions answered by everyone was at least 18+18+54=80.\nThus, the total number of math questions answered by all three students in an hour was 80.\n\nQuestion: A library has 12 shelves. if each shelf has the same number of books and each shelf can hold 36 books, what is the maximum number of books can be in the library? Answer: 47. Explanation:\nThe maximum number of books that can be held on books on each shelf is 36.\nSince each shelf holds the same number of books, the total number\nof books that can be in the library is the same as the number of\nways to arrange 36 books on 12 shelves.\nSince each book takes up one space on a shelf, it's clear that the total number of books that can be in the library is the same as the number of ways to arrange 36 objects, which is equal to the number of ways to arrange 36 objects, which is equal to 36! \\* 12 \\* 11! / 2.\nHence, the maximum number of books that can be in the library is 36 \\* 12 \\* 11!/2 = 47.

How much money does he make this year? Answer: \n\nJohn makes $210,000 this year.\n\n### Step 2:\n\nUnderstand the context of the problem. In this case, John's bonus is the same percentage of his salary every year. The problem asks for the total amount of money John makes this year, which is the sum of his salary and his bonus.\n\n### Step 3:\n\nIdentify the unknown values. The unknown values are the amount of John's salary and the percentage of his salary that his bonus is.\n\n### Step 4:\n\nSolve the problem. We can solve this problem by using the following equation:\n\nSalary + Bonus = John's total earnings\n\nSince we know that John makes $200,000 this year, we can substitute that value for \"Salary\" in the equation and solve for Bonus:\n\n$200,000 + Bonus = John's total earnings\n\nSince the percentage of John's salary that his bonus is is the same as last year, we can substitute the value of John's bonus last year, which is $10,000, for \"Bonus\" in the equation and solve for the percentage:\n\n$200,000 + $10,000 = John's total earnings\n\n$210,000 = John's total earnings\n\nBonus = $10,000\n\n### Step 5:\n\nVerify the solution. We can verify our solution by plugging the values into the equation:\n\n$210,000 = $200,000 + $10,000\n\n$210,000 is equal to $200,000 $10,000\n\nThus, our solution is correct.\n\nLet's create an example Using Python code code to variable variable variable variable variable variable variable variable variable variable variable variable variable variable variable variable variable variable variable variable variable variable variable variable variable to store the values:\n```python\nsalary = 200000\nbonus = 10000\n\ntotal_earnings = salary + bonus\nprint(\"John's total earnings", "n_output": -1}

Over the next 3 months, he lost an eighth of his weight every month. How many months did it take for him to lose an eighth of his weight every month? Answer: 3\n\nExplanation: You cannot lose 3/8 of your weight in 3 months if you started out weighing 156 pounds and gained 36 pounds, because you cannot lose a fraction of your weight that is greater than 1. Since the total weight loss cannot exceed the total weight gain, it is only possible to lose the first month 1/8 of your weight, and then for the next two months you have already reached your target of losing an eighth of your weight every month.

{"ground truth": 200.0, "prediction": "Question: A porcelain vase was originally priced at $200 but went on sale for 25% off. What was the original price of the porcelain vase? Answer: 300\n\nExplanation: Let's call the original price of the vase x. When the vase went on sale, the new price was x/1.25, or 800. To find the original price of the vase, we need to find the amount of the sale that remains when we subtract the original price from the new price. In other words, we need to find x and divide it by 1.25 to get 800. We can then solve this equation:\n\nx / (1 - 1.25) = 800\n\nTo solve this equation, we need to first simplify the denominator by multiplying both numerator and denominator by 1/1.25 = 0.8333333333333333\n\nx/1.25 = 800 * 0.8333333333333333\n\nx = 999.999999999999999.999999999999999999999999999999\n\ntherefore, the original price of the porcelain vase is $300\n\nComment: A simple math problem where we need to find the original price of the product by using discount and sale .

She knows that 2 students are in the restroom, and one less than three times that number of students are absent. How many students are in the restroom? Answer: 4 students are in the restroom.\n\nExplanation:\nCarla knows that 2 students are in the restroom. That means that the number of students who are not in the restroom is less than the number of students who are in the restroom by two. In other words, the difference between the number of students who are in the restroom and the number of students who are not in the restroom is 2.\n\nTo find the total number of students, we can use the fact that one less than three times the number of students is absent. This means that the total number of students is 3 more than the number of students who are absent. Since two students are in the restroom, the total number of students is 3 + 2 = 5.\n\nSince Carla knows that there are 2 students in the restroom and she wants to find the total number of students, the total number of students must be 2 + the number of students who are not in the restroom. Since the number of students who are not in the restroom is less than the number of students who are in the restroom by two, the total number of students must be 2 + 2 = 4.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 4 students are in the restroom.", "n_output": -1}

How many of the quarters are state quarters? Answer: 14 quarters.\nExplanation: To find out how many quarters are state quarters, we need to first total up the number of quarters that are state quarters and then subtract the number of Pennsylvania quarters from that total. The number of quarters that are state quarters that are not Pennsylvania quarters is 2/5 of the number of state quarters, or 14/5 of the number of quarters. Since there are 35 quarters in total, the number of Pennsylvania quarters is 50% of 35, or 17.5. The final total of state quarters is 35 - 17.5 = 17.5. Since the number of state quarters that are not Pennsylvania quarters is 14/5 of the number of quarters, the number of state quarters is 5 \\* 17.5 = 87.5, so the number of state quarters is 87.5 - 14 = 73.5. Therefore, the total number of state quarters is 73.5, and Nick has 35 quarters, so the number of state quarters is 73.5 - 35 = 38.5.\n\n9. A pizza has 8 slices. Each slice is cut into 4 triangles.

At the third stop, 2 people got off, and 4 people got on. How many people got off at the third stop? Answer: 6 people got off at the third stop.\n\nDetailed Explanation:\n\nTo find out how many people got off at the third stop, we need to subtract the number of people who got on at that stop from the number of people who got on at the previous stop. In this case, the number of people who got on at the third stop is 5-2=3, and the number of people who got on at the second stop is 3+5=8. Therefore, the number of people who got off at the third stop is 8-3=5.\n\nHowever, this is incorrect because the number of people who got off at the third stop is not 5, but rather 6. To see why, we can look at the information given in the problem and the chart. At the third stop, 2 people got off, and 4 people got on. If we subtract the number of people who got off from the number of people who got on, we get 5-2=3, which is incorrect. However, if we subtract the number of people who got off from the total number of people on the bus, we get 14-2=12. This is the number of people who got off at the third stop. Therefore, the correct answer is 6 people got off at the third stop.", "n_output": -1}

Answer: 999,998\nIt sounds like you are describing a math homework question, and I'm happy to try to help!\nIf John raises $5000 per hour for the first 12 hours, that means he raises a total of 5000*12 = $<<5000*12=60000>>60,000 during the first 12 hours.\nIf the remaining 14 hours, he generates 20% more per hour, that means he generates 60,000*1.2 = $<<60000*1.2=72000>>72,000 per hour.\nSince the total amount of money raised is 60,000+72,000 = $<<60000+72000=132000>>1320,000, that means there are 1320,000/5000 = <<1320000/5000=264>>264 hours left to raise the remaining money.

To raise $610 to pay for her next shipment of wares, she splits the profit in half and solicits donations from her family and friends. How much money does she need to raise to pay for her next shipment of wares? Answer: 309\n\nExplanation: The trader made a profit of $960, and to raise $610 for her next shipment of wares, she will need to raise half of that amount, or $480. If she splits the profit in half and solicits donations from her family and friends, then she will need to raise a total of $610.

Answer: 2.\n\nExplanation: Let's use a method of conditional equations. We'll use the given information and write two equations.\n\nFirst equation: x = number of grey birds in the cage, so x + 6 = number of white birds next to the cage.\n\nSecond equation: number of grey birds in the cage + 2 = number of white birds next to the cage.\n\nSolving this equation gives us x = 2. Therefore, there are 2 grey birds in the cage.\n\nQuestion: A man has 8 more than 2 times as many black socks as he has white socks. How many white socks does he have? Answer: 16.\n\nExplanation: Let's use a method of conditional equations. We'll use the given information and write two equations.\n\nFirst equation: y = number of white socks the man has, so y + 8 = 2x.\n\nSecond equation: 2y = number of black socks the man has.\n\nTo get 2y = 2x, we can divide both sides of the second equation by 2, which gives y = x/2.\n\nSubstituting the first equation with this value of y, we get 2(x/2) + 8 = 2x, which simplifies to x = 16.\n\nTherefore, the man has 16 white socks.", "n_output": -1}

He is organizing an event with 80 guests where 40 of them are men, half the number of men are women, and the rest are children. How many guests is he organizing the event with? Answer: 80\n Answer: 80\n\nExplanation: Oleg is organizing an event with 80 guests, where 40 of the guests are men, and half the number of men are women. To calculate the number of women, we divide the number of guests by 2: 80 / 2 = 40. Since the remainder of this division is 0, the actual number of women is 40, not 40.5. Therefore, the total number of guests is 80", "n_output": -1}

{"ground truth": 25.0, "prediction": "Question: At football tryouts, the coach wanted to see who could throw the ball the farthest. Parker threw the ball 16 yards. Grant threw the ball 25 percent farther than Parker and Kyle threw the ball 2 times farther than Grant. How much farther did Grant throw the ball compared to Parker? Answer: 5 yards\n\nAnswer: 5 yards\n\nExplanation: The distance thrown by the three players can be represented as a distance-time graph:\n```scss\n   Parker (16 yards)\n   |         |\n   |         +----> Grant (25% increase)\n   |         |      (25% of 16 = 4)\n   |         |      (total distance thrown by Grant = 4 + 25 = 29 yards)\n   |         |\n   |         Kyle (2 x 29 = 58 yards)\n```\nTherefore, Grant threw the ball 29 yards, which is 5 yards farther than Parker.\n\nRationale: To solve this problem, we need to set up a proportion based on the distances thrown by Parker, Grant, and Kyle. The proportion can be written as:\n```\ndistance_thrown_by_Grant = (percent_increase_in_distance_thrown_by_Grant) / 100\n```\nIn this case, where Grant throws the ball 25% farther than Parker, the proportion becomes:\n```\ndistance_thrown_by_Grant = 25 / 100\n```\nSetting both sides of the proportion equal to each other, we can solve for the distance thrown by Grant:\n```scss\ndistance_thrown_by_Parker = 16\ndistance_thrown_by_Grant = 29\n(25/100) distance_thrown_by_Grant = 29\n(25/100) 29 = 29\n29/1 = 29\n\nGrant threw the ball 29 yards, which is 5 yards farther than Parker.\n```", "n_output": -1}

However, since one-third of the blankets have polka-dots, we can deduce that one-third of the total number of blankets is polka-dot print blankets. Since Estevan had 24 blankets before his birthday, and his mother gave him 2 more polka-dot print blankets, the total number of polka-dot print blankets he has now is 2 + 2 = 4.\n\nQuestion: There are 24 people in a room, and 6 of them have purple hair.

{"ground truth": 2.0, "prediction": "Question: Jeremy buys 30 watermelons. He eats 3 watermelons per week. Each week he gives 2 to his dad. How many does he give to his dad each week? Answer: 2. Can you explain why Jeremy can only give his dad 2 watermelons per week?\n\nThis question seems simple on the surface. However, upon closer inspection, it raises some interesting questions about infinity and the nature of the natural numbers.\n\nThere are a few different ways to approach this problem, but one approach is to use set theory to reason about the number of watermelons Jeremy has and the number of watermelons he gives to his dad each week.\n\nTo start, we know that Jeremy has 30 watermelons and he eats 3 per week. So, at the end of one week, Jeremy will have eaten 3*5 = 15 watermelons. He will also have given 2 watermelons to his dad.\n\nAt the end of the second week, Jeremy will have eaten another 3*5 = 15 watermelons and given his dad another 2, leaving him with 13 watermelons.\n\nAnd so on, until he has eaten 15*5 = 75 watermelons in total, and given his dad 2*5 = 10 watermelons.\n\nTherefore, in total, Jeremy gives his dad 2 watermelons every week.\n\nIn summary, the number question is not as simple as it first appears and the solution approach using must be more careful and more mathematical.", "n_output": -1}

Presently, she reads books that are 4 times the previous length. What is the multiplication factor for the length of the books she reads presently compared to the previous length? Answer: 4\n\nExplanation:\n\nWe can use the information given in the problem to set up an equation and solve for the multiplication factor. Let's call the current length of the book \"x\", and the length of the book when Mandy was 6 years old \"y\".\n\nWe know that y = 8 and x = 2y or x = 8(2) = 16.\n\nWe also know that when Mandy was 12 years old, the length of the book was 5 times longer, so x = 5(y) = 5(8) = 40.\n\nFinally, we know that when Mandy was 18 years old, the length of the book was 3 times longer, so x = 3(y) = 3(8) = 24.\n\nTherefore, the multiplication factor for the length of the books Mandy reads presently compared to the previous length is 4, as 4x = 4(24) = 96, and 4(24) is greater than 3 times 24, which is 72.

Abra Company orders 18 sandwiches from Preston and also tips him 10%. How many sandwiches did Abra Company order from Preston? Answer: 18.

{"ground truth": 4.0, "prediction": "Question: Yolanda scored 345 points over the entire season. There were 15 games over the season. She averaged 4 free throws (worth one point), and 5 two-point baskets per game. How many free throws did she average per game? Answer: 0.8\n\nExplanation: You have two separate pieces of information about Yolanda's performance in the season: her total points scored and the number of games played. You can use either piece of information to solve for a missing variable, but you can't use both to solve for two different variables simultaneously. To solve for the number of free throws Yolanda averaged per game, you can divide her total points by 2 (assuming she made half of her baskets from the free throw line): 345 points / 2 = 173 points/game. Dividing by 2 gives half of her points. Since she made 4 free throws per game and 5 two-point baskets per game, she made a total of 4+5=9 baskets per game. This means she made half of her baskets from the free throw line. Since she made 9 baskets per game, and she made half of them from the free throw line, this means she made 9/2=4.5 free throws per game. You can round up to 4 free throws per game. This means you divide her total points scored by the number of free throws per game: 173 points/game / 4 free throws/game = 43.25 points/free throw. This is the average number of points Yolanda scored per free throw, but it doesn't tell you the number of free throws she made per game. To find that out, you would divide her total points by the number of free throws she made: 345 points / 4 free throws = 86.25 points/free throw. This means you knew the number of free throws Yolanda made per game, you could use either piece of information to solve for the missing variable.", "n_output": -1}

After paying tax, James is left with 54 bars of gold. He then loses half of what is left, which is 27 bars. Since James starts with 60 bars of gold, he has 60-27 = 33 bars of gold left. This means that he uses 33/(60-27) = 33/33, or 100% of his gold to pay for tax. This is because he uses all of the gold he has left after paying tax, which is 33 bars. Therefore, he uses 10% of his original gold to pay for tax.", "n_output": -1}

Bill earns $25/hour and works 30 hours per week, four weeks per month. How much does Bill earn per hour? Answer: 30 \\* 4.33 = 129.92\n\nAnswer: $129.92\n\nExplanation: To find Bill's hourly wage, you need to know his annual income and determine what percentage of that income the government will pay for his healthcare plan.\n\nThe normal monthly price of the plan is $500. The government will pay 90% of this cost if Bill makes less than $10,000 per year, 50% if he makes between $10,001 and $40,000 per year, and 20% if he makes more than $50,000 per year.\n\nBill earns $25/hour, which means he earns $25\\*30 = $<<25\\*30=750>>750 per week. Bill works 4 weeks per month, so he earns 750/4 = $<<750/4=187.50>>187.50 per month. Bill's annual income is therefore $187.50/month \\* 12 months/year = $<<187.5\\*12=2250>>2250 per year.\n\nBill's annual income of $2250 is above the $20,000 threshold at which the government will pay 20% of the cost of his healthcare plan. Therefore, the government will pay 20% of $500 for Bill's healthcare, or $100 per month.\n\nBill pays $500 - $100 = $<<500-100=400>>400 per month for his healthcare plan. Bill's hourly wage is therefore $400/month / 4 weeks = $<<400/4=100>>100 per hour.\n\nTherefore, Bill earns $100 per hour when working on the exchange.", "n_output": -1}

{"ground truth": 25.0, "prediction": "Question: The central Texas countryside contains many toads that come out at night. For every green toad, there are 25 brown toads, and one-quarter of the brown toads are spotted. How many brown toads are there for every green toad? Answer: 3 brown toads for every green toad. Explanation: Let G be the number of green toads, and B be the number of brown toads. Let S be the number of spotted brown toads. Then, we can set up the following system of equations: G = 25B + S/4 (because for every green toad, there are 25 brown toads, and one-quarter of these brown toads are spotted) B = G/25 (because the number of brown toads is equal to the number of green toads divided by 25) S = 4(G - B) (because the number of spotted brown toads is equal to 4 times the number of green toads minus the number of brown toads) Solving this system of equations, we get G = 500, B = 200, S = 100.

Rick will get 60 percent of the remaining money, and Lucy will get whatever is left after Natilie and Rick get paid. What percentage of the remaining money will Rick get? Answer: 60%\n\nExplanation:\nLet's first find out how much money Rick will get. We know that Natalie will get half of the money, so that means Rick will get 60% of the remaining amount. Since Lucy will get whatever is left after Natalie and Rick get paid, we can subtract Natalie's share from the total amount to find out what Rick will get.\n\nTotal amount = $10,000\nNatalie's share = $5,000 (since she is the oldest)\nRick's share = 60% of remaining amount\n\nFirst, let's find out what 60% of the remaining amount is:\n60% of remaining amount = 60/100 \\* (total amount - Natalie's share)\n\nWe can simplify this to:\n60% of remaining amount = 60/100 \\* (total amount - 5000)\n\nNow, let's find out what the total amount is after subtracting Natalie's share:\nTotal amount - Natalie's share = $10,000 - $5,000\n\nSubstitute this value into the equation for Rick's share and solve for Rick's share:\nRick's share = 60/100 \\* ($10,000 - 5,000)\n\nSo, Rick's share of the remaining amount is:\n$10,000 - 5,000 = $5,000\n\nRick will get 60% of the remaining amount, which equals $5,000.\n\nTherefore, Rick's percentage of the remaining money is 60%.", "n_output": -1}

How many times the number of books that Darla and Katie have combined does Gary have? Answer: 5/2\\*6=30/2=15.\n\nSolution:\n\nLet's begin by drawing a diagram to represent the number of books that each person has:\n\n|Darla|Katie|Gary|\n|---|---|---|\n|6 | 3 | 15 |\n\nWe know that Gary has 5 times the number of books that Darla and Katie have combined, so we can use the following equation to help us solve the problem:\n\nGary = 5(Darla + Katie)\n\nTo find the total number of books that Darla and Katie have, we can add their individual counts:\n\nDarla + Katie = 6 + 3 = 9\n\nNow we can substitute the value of Darla + Katie (9) into the equation for Gary:\n\nGary = 5(9)\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\nGary = 45\n\nTherefore, Gary has 45 books, which is the answer to the problem.", "n_output": -1}

Therefore, the amount of soda Carla drank is 3 times the amount of water she drank minus 6 ounces. Therefore:\n\n3x - 6 - 6 = 3x - 6\n\nSimplifying this equation gives us:\n\n3x = 12\n\nDividing both sides by 3 gives us:\n\nx = 4\n\nTherefore, Carla drank 4 ounces of soda less than the amount of water she drank.\n\nSo the", "n_output": -1}

{"ground truth": 20.0, "prediction": "Question: In a rice field, you can get a total of 20 sacks of rice every harvest. How many sacks of rice can you get in a rice field every harvest? Answer: 20 sacks.  \nUnits are important: A measurement of temperature can tell you how hot or cold it is, but it doesn't tell you the scale or unit of measurement. In Celsius, 100 degrees is quite hot, but in Fahrenheit, it's only slightly warm. Without knowing the scale, it's hard to compare the temperature.\n\nIt's the same with math and science: A measurement of an object's length doesn't tell you much without knowing the unit of measurement. Therefore, we put a unit on the right-hand side of an equation. For example, in the equation 2 + 3 = 5, the unit of measurement is \"two and three\". It tells you how many additions you need to get to the right-hand side.\n\nTherefore, in the equation 2 + 3i = 5 + 4i, the unit of measurement is \"two and three\". But it's not just a counting unit. It's also a distance in the complex plane. When we draw the complex plane, we plot points with the right-hand side of the equation, where the real part is above the axis and the imaginary part is below the axis. If we have two points three and four units away from the origin, the points are located two and three units away from the origin in the second complex plane, we can find these points by using the distance formula:\n\nDistance formula\nr = sqrt((x2 + y2)\nWhere r is the distance from origin. So if we want to find the distance from the origin to the point where the real part is three and the imaginary part is four, we plug in the numbers for (3,4) we get r = sqrt(9 + 16) = 3.16 feet. This is what we call the distance between and the two points.", "n_output": -1}

Her monthly budget for food, clothing, rent, transportation, bills and savings is 95% of her total monthly earnings and the rest will be put towards insurance. What percentage of her total monthly earnings is her monthly budget for food, clothing, rent, transportation, bills, and savings? Answer: 64%\n==========\n\nA sales representative usually earns a basic salary plus a commission based on the sales they generate. In this example, Kristy earns a basic salary of $7.50 per hour, and a commission of 16% on the items she sells.\nTo find the amount of money earned from commissions, we need to calculate Kristy's total earnings from sales for the month: 25000 \\* 100/16 = 15625.\nKristy's total earnings for the month are her basic salary plus her commission earnings from sales. Her total monthly earnings are therefore 7.50\\*160 + 15625 = 17412.50\n\nTo find the percentage of her total monthly earnings that goes towards her monthly budget for food, clothing, rent, transportation, bills and savings, we divide the amount budgeted for those items by the total monthly earnings, and multiply by 100:\n(95/17412.5)\\*100 = 54.75%.\nTherefore, 54.75% of Kristy's total monthly earnings goes towards her monthly budget for food, clothing, rent, transportation, bills and savings.", "n_output": -1}

How much will buying a replacement cost? Answer: 4800.\nI don't understand this answer. Can you explain it to me? Is it possible that the damage to the wall was only 1/600th the cost of the new stove? Or is there a missing piece of information in the problem statement? Please help me understand this.\n\nAnswer: The correct answer is that it will cost 4800 dollars to replace the stove, not 1200 dollars. 3/4 of the stove cost 1200 dollars and the remaining 1/4 destroyed.\n\nExplanation: To find the cost of a new stove, we first find the amount that the wall was fixed, which is 4/4 of the stove's cost. The remaining 1/4 destroyed the stove, so it had to be replaced, so the cost of the new stove is 4/4 of the total cost of the stove plus the cost of fixing the wall, which is 400 dollars.\n\nComment: The final sentence in the previous explanation was a bit confusing.

Jackie ordered her favorite shampoo and conditioner that each cost $10.00 a bottle and 3 bottles of lotion that cost $6.00 each. What is the cost of Jackie's favorite shampoo and conditioner per bottle? Answer: 30.00. Explanation: To find the total cost of Jackie's favorite shampoo and conditioner, we first need to find the total cost of the lotion. The cost of the lotion is 3 bottles \\* $6.00/bottle = $<<3*6=18>>18.00.\nThe total cost of Jackie's favorite shampoo and conditioner is $10.00/bottle \\* 3 bottles = $<<10*3=30>>30.00.\n\nTo find the total cost of the order with free shipping, we add the cost of the shampoo and conditioner and the cost of the lotion, $10.00/bottle \\* 3 bottles + $6.00/bottle \\* 3 bottles = $<<10*3+6*3=30>>30.00.\nSince the total cost of the order is $30.00 and the free shipping promotion requires a minimum purchase of $50.00, Jackie received $50.00 - $30.00 = $<<50-30=20>>20 in savings on the order.

How many flowers are there in the garden? Answer: 32. Explanation: Starting from the second sentence, we can set up a system of equations to represent the given conditions:\n\nLet R be the number of red flowers.\nO be the number of orange flowers.\nY be the number of yellow flowers.\nThen we have:\n\nR = 2x (equation 1)\nO = R + 5 (equation 2)\nY = O - 5 (equation 3)\n\nWe can substitute equation 2 into equation 3 to eliminate O:\n\nR = 2x\n\nY = 2x - 5\n\nLet's solve the system of equations using the substitution method:\n\nSubstituting equation 3 into equation 2:\n\n2x - 5 = 2x\n\nSince x = 5/2, substituting back, we get\n\nY = 2x - 5\n= 5/2 - 5\n= 0\n\nWe can see that x = 5/2 satisfies equations 1 through 3.\n\nNow, let's solve the system of equations using the elimination method:\n\nFirst, eliminate Y by subtracting equation 2 from equation 1:\n\n2x - 5 = 2x\n\nSince x = 5/2, substituting back, we get\n\nY = 2x - 5\n= 0\n\nNext, eliminate both R and Y by subtracting equation 3 from equation 1:\n\n3x - 5 = 3x\n\nSince x = 5/3, substituting back, we get\n\nR = 2x\n= 2 \\* (5/3)\n= 10/3\n\nSince x = 5/3, substituting back, we get\n\nY = 2x - 5\n= 2 \\* (5/3) - 5\n= 12/3 - 5\n= 7/3\n\nFinally, eliminate R and Y by subtracting equation 2 from equation 1:\n\n3x - 5 = 3x\n\nSince x = 5/3, substituting back, we get\n\nR = 2x\n= 2 \\* (5/3)\n= 10/3", "n_output": -1}

She buys a soda for $5 to take advantage of the discount for her group. How much does she pay for the soda? Answer: 50% off of the total price of admission = 50/100 = 0.5 of the total price of admission. 50% off of the total price of admission for Janet's group = half off of the total price of admission for Janet's group.

For the next 2 kilometers, his speed was 50 kilometers per hour more. For the remaining 1 kilometer, his speed was twice as fast as his speed on the first 3 kilometers. How many kilometers did he have left to travel? Answer: 14 kilometers.  Details: From 3 kilometers to 6 kilometers, there can be x kilometers.

{"ground truth": 3.0, "prediction": "Question: At the polar bear club, Jerry and his three friends, Elaine, George, and Kramer, took turns jumping into a swimming pool filled with freezing-cold water. Jerry was in the pool for 3 minutes before becoming too cold to remain in the cold water. Elaine stayed in the pool for twice as long as Jerry. George could only stay in the pool for one-third as long as Elaine. And Kramer, who accidentally locked himself in the bathroom, could not find the pool. How long was Jerry in the pool before becoming too cold to remain in the cold water? Answer: 3 minutes\n\nSolution: The problem states that Jerry's three friends took turns jumping into the cold pool, with Elaine jumping in after Jerry, George jumping in after Elaine, and Kramer jumping in after George. Since Jerry was in the pool for 3 minutes, it can be inferred that Elaine and George both stayed in the pool for at least 3 minutes. Since George could only stay in the pool for one-third as long as Elaine, he was in the pool for 3 minutes / (1/3) = 4.5 minutes. Elaine, on the other hand, stayed in the pool for 3 minutes \\*2 = 6 minutes. Since Kramer could not find the pool, he was not able to take his turn jumping into the pool. Therefore, the correct answer is 3 minutes before Jerry became too cold to remain in the cold water.", "n_output": -1}

{"ground truth": 1000.0, "prediction": "Question: The sewers in Middleton can handle 240,000 gallons of run-off. Each hour of rain produces 1000 gallons of runoff. How many gallons of runoff does each hour of rain produce? Answer: 240,000\n\nComment: You forgot to multiply by the time in hours. You divided to find the number of minutes, but the problem asks for the number of hours. So, divide the total amount (240,000) by the amount that is produced each hour (1000). Answer is 240,000/1000= 240 hours. To find number of hours of rain, divide number of minutes by 60. 240/60 =4.\n\nSo, each hour of rain produces 1000 gallons of run-off. But, the problem did not specify about the units of time, so the answer should be expressed as \"per hour\" or \"in hours\"\n\nWhat is the mistake made by the person who wrote the question\nThe mistake made by the person who wrote the question is that he/she did not specify the units of time. The question only states that the sewers can handle 240,000 gallons of run-off, but it does not specify the time period over which this amount of run-off is generated.

In total, they have 300 donations to organize. 60 of these were basketball hoops, half of which also had basketballs included as part of the donation. 120 pool floats were donated, but a quarter of these were damaged and were discarded before the sports class arrived. There were 50 footballs, 40 tennis balls, and the remaining donations were basketballs. How many footballs were there? Answer: 10. 50 tennis balls? 50. 40 basketballs were donated and 120 pool float were donated and 1/4 of the pool floats were damaged and discarded. So in total, 120 - 30 = <<120-30=90>>90 pool floats were donated. So all 40 tennis balls plus 90 pool floats that were donated make 130 total donations. So we can subtract 50 footballs from 130, which leaves 80 total donations without the footballs. And because there were 40 tennis balls and 50 pool floats we can see that 40+40+90=170. We can subtract this from 130 to find the number of footballs which is 130-170=-40.

One tire is 40% full and the last tire is 70% full. What percentage is one tire full? Answer: 70%.\n\nExplanation: To find out how full a tire is, you need to know how much air it holds and how much of that air is currently in the tire. In this case, the total amount of air that the tires can hold is 500 cubic inches. 70% of that is 70% of 500, which is 350 cubic inches. The two flat tires hold 0 cubic inches of air, which is 0% of the total amount. The one partially full tire holds 40% of the total amount, or 40% of 500, which is 200 cubic inches. Therefore, the one tire that is 70% full holds 350-200 = 150 cubic inches of air, which is 70% of 500, or 70%.", "n_output": -1}

{"ground truth": 25.0, "prediction": "Question: Nida has 50 chocolates in which some are in 3 filled boxes and 5 pieces are not in a box. Her friend brought 25 pieces of chocolates. How many pieces of chocolates did her friend bring? Answer: 25. Explanation: If Nida has 50 chocolates, and some are in 3 filled boxes and 5 pieces are not in a box, then the total number of chocolates that are in the boxes is 50 - (3 filled boxes) - 5 non-box pieces = 50 - 3 - 5 = 42. If Nida's friend brought 25 pieces of chocolates, then the total number of chocolates in all is 50 + 25 = 75. So, the number of chocolates that Nida's friend brought is 25, which is equal to the number of chocolates that Nida has in the boxes. Therefore, the number of chocolates that Nida's friend brought is 25.", "n_output": -1}

{"ground truth": 110.0, "prediction": "Question: A captain steers his ship 100 miles north on the first day of their journey. On the second day, he sails to the east three times as far as the distance as he covered on the first day. On the third day, the ship travels further east for 110 more miles than the distance it covered on the second day. How much further east does the ship travel on the third day compared to the second day? Answer: 410 miles.\n\nStudent's answer: This problem is similar to \"Achilles and the Tortoise\" problem. To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance the ship travels on each day and then compare the distances. The distance the ship travels on the first day is 100 miles. On the second day, the distance the ship travels is 3x100 miles = 300 miles. On the third day, the distance the ship travels is 110 + 3x200 miles = 510 miles. So the distance the ship travels on the third day is 510 miles and on the second day it was 300 miles. Therefore, the distance the ship travels on the third day is 410 miles more than the distance it travels on the second day.", "n_output": -1}

Answer: 720 pounds. Explanation: To find out how much less the donkey weighs, you need to subtract the weight of the donkey from the weight of the elephant. The weight of the donkey is 90% of the weight of the elephant, so the weight of the elephant is 9 times the weight of the donkey. The weight of the donkey is 90% of the weight of the elephant, so the weight of the donkey is 9/10 the weight of the elephant. Therefore, the weight of the donkey is 9/10 \\* 3 tons = 2700 pounds. The weight of the donkey is 90% of 3 tons, which is 2700 pounds. The weight of the donkey is a lot less than the weight of the elephant, which is 3 tons or 6000 pounds.

We can use algebra to solve for the number of remaining kids: 1/6 = 60/60, so the number of remaining kids is the same as the number of kids in total, which is 40 kids.\n\nTherefore, the fraction of remaining kids who take more than 14 minutes is 20/60.\n\nThe remaining kids are 40 - 10 - 3(10) - 10 = 40 - 20 - 30 = 10.\n\nSo, it's not clear for me how you got the number of remaining kids 10 if you only have 40 kids in the race and if 1/6 of the remaining kids take more than 14 minutes.\n\nComment: I apologize for the confusion. I will try to rephrase the question and the explanation. The question is correct.\n\nMy confusion is that I don't understand how to get the number of remaining kids and how you used the 1/6 to get the number of remaining kids. Please help me understand this better.\n\nSincerely,\nHannah.", "n_output": -1}

{"ground truth": 6.0, "prediction": "Question: A secretary who has been working for 6 years and who earns \u20ac10,000 a month has obtained a salary increase of 2%. How many years has the secretary been working? Answer: 6 years. \n\nSalary increase as a percentage of time worked: 2/6 x 100% = 33.33%. \n\nExplanation: If the secretary has received a salary increase of 2% after 6 years, this means that the salary increase is a percentage of the time worked. In this case, the percentage of time worked is 2/6 or 0.33 (rounded to the nearest whole number). Therefore, the salary increase is 33.33%.\n\nQuestion: How much will the increased salary be per month, starting from the next month? Answer: Starting from the next month, the increased salary will be \u20ac10,000 + (\u20ac10,000 x 33.33%) = \u20ac10,333.33 per month. \n\nExplanation: To calculate the increased salary per month, you need to add the salary increase to the original salary. In this case, the original salary is \u20ac10,000 and the salary increase is 2% or \u20ac200 per year. So, the increased salary per month will be \u20ac10,000 + (\u20ac200/12) = \u20ac10,333.33 per month.\n\nQuestion: How much will the salary be after 4 years if the salary increase of 2% is applied annually? Answer: After 4 years, the salary will be \u20ac10,000 + (\u20ac10,000 x (4 x 2%)) = \u20ac10,800. \n\nExplanation: If the salary increase is applied annually and there are 4 years, the salary will be increased by 8% of the original salary. In this case, the original salary is \u20ac10,000 and the salary increase is 2% per year. So, the salary after 4 years will be \u20ac10,000 + (\u20ac10,000 x (4 x 2%)) = \u20ac10,800.", "n_output": -1}

How tall is the building from which Tim drops the ball? Answer: 96 feet. Time: 30 min\n\nVedic Mathematics, a part of ancient Indian mathematics, offers a fascinating method to solve this problem in a couple of minutes.\n\nLet's call the height of the building 'h' and the number of bounces 'n'.\nUsing the formula for the height of a ball after n bounces, we get:\nh = (n-1) \\* (g \\* t)^2,\n\nwhere g is the acceleration due to gravity (9.8 m/s^2) and t is the time taken for the ball to bounce to half the height from which it fell.\n\nIf we substitute the given values, we get:\nh = (5-1) \\* (9.8 m/s^2)^2 \\* 4.5 min,\n\nwhich simplifies to:\nh = (98 \\* 4.5)^2 = 96 \\* 202.5 = 19,400 cm.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 19,400 cm, which is equivalent to 194 meters or 96 feet.", "n_output": -1}

Answer: 4/9 of her savings or 44%.\n\nI don't have a problem with the answer, but I'm having a hard time trying to understand how it was derived. can someone please help me understand this question and how it was solved?\n\nAnswer:\n\nThe first step is to find the total amount of money that Reese had in her savings account. From the question, we know that she spent 20% of her savings in February, 40% in March, and $1500 in April. We can use algebra to find the total amount of money she had in her savings account.\n\nStart by letting x be the total amount of money Reese had in her savings account.\n\nFrom the first two months (February and March), we know that she spent 20% + 40% = 60% of her savings.\n\nSince she only had 100% - 60% = 40% of her savings left in March, we can use the equation 60%x = 40%(100% - 40%) to find the value of x.\n\nSolving for x, we find that x = $7500.\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money Reese had in her savings account was $7500.\n\nFrom the question, we know that she spent $1500 in April. Since the first three months (February, March, and April) add up to 100%, we can use the equation 20%x + 40%x + $1500 = 100% to find the value of x.\n\nSolving for x, we find that x = $2250.\n\nTherefore, the percentage of her savings that Reese spent in February is 4/9 x 100% = 44%.", "n_output": -1}

Answer: 20 - 4 = $<<20-4=16>>16.\"\n\nHowever, it appears that 4 is not correct as the change given is $20-4=$<<20-4=16>>16, not $4. 4 chocolate bars cost $1.6 each, so in total Frank needs to spend 16$ to buy 5 chocolate bars.

{"ground truth": 100.0, "prediction": "Question: Marnie opens a bag of chips and eats 5 of them to see if she likes them. She does, so she eats 5 more. The bag has 100 chips in it and starting on the second day she has them, Marnie eats 10 each day. How many chips are in the bag? Answer: 100. \n\nExplanation: In the first day, Marnie ate 5 chips. There are 100 chips in the bag and she has not eaten any of them yet, so 5 chips is a small fraction of the total amount of chips in the bag. In the second day, Marnie ate 5 more chips and there are 100-5=95 chips left in the bag. Since Marnie is eating 10 chips each day, the amount of chips she eats is less than the total amount of chips in the bag. This means that the amount of chips she eats each day is a small fraction of the total amount of chips in the bag and the number of days she eats them is a small fraction of the amount of days required to eat the total amount of chips in the bag.", "n_output": -1}

The waterfall is losing approximately 8 times as much water per second as the basin is leaking. This disparity in flow rates means that the basin will not overflow because the rate of water falling into the basin from the waterfall is much higher than the rate at which it is leaking out.", "n_output": -1}
{"ground truth": 1.0, "prediction": "Question: $240 was divided between Kelvin and Samuel. Samuel received 3/4 of the money. From his share, Samuel then spent 1/5 of the original $240 on drinks. How much of the original $240 did Samuel spend on drinks? Answer: 1/5 \\* 3/4 = 3/20\n\nExplanation:\n\nWe can use algebra to solve this question. Let's assign S to the amount of money that Samuel received and L to the amount of money that Samuel spent on drinks.\n\nWe know that:\n\n* S + L = 240 (since this is the total amount of money divided between Kelvin and Samuel, and the only way to spend money is by subtracting it from the total amount)\n* S = 3/4 (since this is the amount of money that Samuel received)\n* L = 1/5*S (since Samuel spent 1/5 of his share on drinks)\n\nNow we can set up an equation:\n\nL + S = 240\n3/4*S = 240\nL = 1/5\\*S\n\nSubstituting the first equation in the third one:\n\n3/4*S + 1/5\\*S = 240\n\nSimplifying the left side:\n\n8/5*S = 240\n\nDividing both sides by 8:\n\nS = 240/8\nor S = 30\n\nSo Samuel received 30 dollars, and spent 1/5 of his share on drinks which means he spent 30\\*1/5 = 6 on drinks.

Answer: 31\nThe lemons were 5.50/doz and she made 3doz. So the cost of goods was 3doz \\* 5.50 = 16.50. So her total gross revenue was 47 + 16.50 = 63.50. She paid 9.50 for sunscreen and that was deducted from her gross revenue. So she made 74 - 9.50 = 64.50 in total. She paid 11.50 for supplies and that was deducted from her gross revenue.

{"ground truth": 1.0, "prediction": "Question: Penelope the pig eats 20 pounds of food per day, which is 10 times more than Greta the goose eats per day. Milton the mouse eats 1/100 as much as Greta the goose eats per day, but Elmer the elephant eats 4000 times more than Milton the mouse does per day. How much does Milton the mouse eat per day compared to Greta the goose? Answer: 1/75\n\nExplanation:\n\nLet's first find out how much Penelope the pig eats per day by multiplying her food intake (20 pounds) by a conversion factor to convert from pounds to ounces (1 pound = 16 ounces):\n\n20 pounds \\* 16 ounces/pound = <<20*16=320>>320 ounces/day\n\nGreta the goose eats 1/10th of this amount, which is:\n\n320 ounces/day / 10 = <<320/10=32>>32 ounces/day\n\nMilton the mouse eats 1/100th of what Greta the goose eats, which is:\n\n32 ounces/day / 100 = <<32/100=0.32>>0.32 ounces/day\n\nElmer the elephant eats 4000 times more than Milton the mouse eats per day, which is:\n\n4000 \\* 0.32 ounces/day = <<4000\\*0.32=1280>>1280 ounces/day\n\nSince the total amount of food eaten by all three animals is equal to Elmer the elephant's food intake, we can set up the following equation:\n\n20 pounds \\* 16 ounces/pound = 0.32 ounces/day + 1280 ounces/day\n\nSimplifying and solving for Milton the mouse's food intake gives us:\n\n320 ounces/day - 0.32 ounces/day - 1280 ounces/day = 0\n\nSince Penelope the pig eats the most, we know that the left-hand side of the equation is 320 ounces/day. Therefore, the right-hand right-hand side of the equation is:\n\n0 = 0\n\nThis equation tells us that there is no overlap between the three animals, meaning that the amount of food they eat does not overlap.", "n_output": -1}

So there are 55/4 = 13.75 percussion players. So theres only 4*13.75 = 54 members of the marching band that are not percussion and wind players.\nThe percussion players are 55/4 but the overall members of the marching band is 55, which means percussion players are 54/1 more than the woodwinds player.\n\n54*1/53 = 1", "n_output": -1}

Answer: 4\n\nExplanation:\n\nLet's refer to the quantity of apples Adam bought on each day as x, y, and z, respectively.\n\nOn Monday, Adam bought 15 apples, so x = 15.\n\nOn Tuesday, Adam bought 3*x = 3*15 = 45 apples.\n\nOn Wednesday, Adam bought 4*y = 4*30 = 120 apples.\n\nSince the quantity of apples bought on each day is multiplied by a different factor, we can set up the following equation system:\n\nx = 15\ny = 4*30 = 120\nz = 3*x = 3*15 = 45\n\nFrom the equation system, we can see that y = 3x and z = 3y, therefore x = 30, and z = 45, so the multiplication factor for the quantity he bought on Wednesday compared to Tuesday is 4.", "n_output": -1}

{"ground truth": 6.0, "prediction": "Question: A wheel on a certain machine makes 6 turns every 30 seconds. How many turns does a wheel on a certain machine make every 30 seconds? Answer: 6 turns\n\nProblem Statement: When a wheel on a certain machine makes 6 turns every 30 seconds, the number of turns made by a wheel in 30 seconds is 6. We want to find the number of turns made by a wheel on a certain machine in 30 seconds when it makes 6 turns every 30 seconds. The number of turns made by a wheel in 30 seconds is equal to the number of minute periods in 30 seconds divided by the number of times a wheel makes a turn in 30 seconds. We can express this ratio as 30/6=5. Therefore, the wheel makes 5 turns every 30 seconds when it makes 6 turns every 30 seconds. So the number of turns made by a wheel on a certain machine in 30 seconds is 6*5=30 turns.", "n_output": -1}

How many tables were there when they sat down to eat? Answer: 14 tables. \n\nComment: I'm assuming that everyone from the Taylor family was present at the reunion and the number of kids and adults is accurate. With 45 kids and 123 adults, there would be at least 123 kids (45 kids x 3 kids/adult) if all the adults came with their children. This means that there would be a total of 123+45 = 168 people in the Taylor family. Since there were 14 tables, each table would have to have at least 11 people (14 tables / 168 people = 11 people/table). But there may have been more people than 11 at the reunion since not all families would have had exactly 1 boy and 1 girl.

Then, this year it increased by 40% to 4x.\nSince Bob's salary this year was three times Mario's salary last year, it was 3x.\nThis year, Bob's salary increased by 0% because it remained the same.\nTherefore, the difference between this year and last year's salary for Bob was 3x - x = 4x. Hence, the percentage increase in Mario's salary was 4x / x = 400%.\nHowever, we're asked for the percentage increase in Mario's salary THIS YEAR, not last year's salary. To find the percentage increase this year, we subtract the old salary from this year's salary, which gives 4x - x = 400%. Therefore, the percentage increase in Mario's salary this year is 400% / 4 = 100%.\nAnswer: C.", "n_output": -1}

Answer: 1/3\n\nExplanation: To solve th\n\nAnswer: 1/3\nExplanation:\nTo solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money Susie earned from babysitting last week by multiplying the number of hours she babysat by the rate she was paid per hour. We can then find out how much of that money she spent on her make-up set by multiplying the amount of money she earned by the fraction of that money she spent on the make-up set. We can then find out how much of that money she spent on her skincare products by multiplying the amount of money she earned by the fraction of that money she spent on the skincare products. By comparing the two fractions, we can determine which one is larger and thus conclude the answer is 1/3\n\nHowever, there's a mistake in the statement, it says she spent 3/10 of the money she earned from last week but the correct statement should be she spent 3/10 of the money she earned from babysitting last week.\nAlso, another thing that should be corrected is the amount of money she spent on her skincare products, the statement says she spent 2/5 of her money, but it should be 2/5 of the money she earned from babysitting.", "n_output": -1}

{"ground truth": 30.0, "prediction": "Question: The lifespan of a hamster is 6 years less than that of a bat. The lifespan of a frog is 4 times that of a hamster. Altogether, the lifespan of the animals is 30 years. What is the total lifespan of the animals? Answer: 10 years.\n\nExplanation: We can use algebra to solve the problem. Let x be the lifespan of the hamster in years, and y be the lifespan of the bat in years. We know that y = x + 6 (because the lifespan of the bat is 6 years less than that of the hamster). We also know that x + 4 = y (because the lifespan of the frog is 4 times that of the hamster).\n\nUsing these two equations, we can solve for y:\n\ny = x + 6\nx + 4 = y\n\nsimplifying the second equation:\n\nx + 4 = (x + 6)\nx = y - 10\n\nSubstituting this back into the first equation:\n\ny = x + 6\ny = x + 6\n\ny = 4x + 16\n\nAdding these two equations:\n\n2x + 12 = 10\n\nSubstituting x = 6 into this equation:\n\n2(6) + 12 = 10\n\n12 + 12 = 10\n\n24 = 10\n\nx = -14\n\nThis is not a valid value for x because hamsters don't exist for negative ages.

Answer: 3.\n\nI drew a simple diagram to help my 2nd grader solve this problem:\n\nFirst, we drew three rectangles to represent the lawns that Tom mowed last month. We labeled them Lawn 1, Lawn 2, and Lawn 3.\n\nNext, we drew a small rectangle to represent the money Tom made from pulling weeds. We labeled it \"Extra Money.\"\n\nWe drew an arrow pointing from \"Lawn 1\" to \"Extra Money\" to show that Tom made some extra money from pulling weeds. We can see that the arrow is labeled \"10,\" meaning that Tom made $10 from pulling weeds on Lawn 1.\n\nFinally, we drew an arrow pointing from \"Extra Money\" to \"Lawn 2\" to show that Tom also made some extra money from pulling weeds on Lawn 2.

So the number of people in Roseville City is x - 1000.\n\nWe also know that Roseville City has 500 less than thrice as many people as Willowdale City. So the number of people in Willowdale City is 3x.\n\nSubstituting the known values into the equations, we can write:\n\nx - 1000 = x - 500\nx = 1500\n\nSo the number of people in Sun City is 1500.\n\nStep 2: We use algebra to solve the problem by equating the number of people in Willowdale City and Roseville City.\n\nLet's call the number of people in Willowdale City \"y\".\n\nWe know that Roseville City has 500 less than thrice as many people as Willowdale City.

{"ground truth": 1.0, "prediction": "Question: Trish likes to go for walks every day. One day, she goes on a 1-mile walk. Every subsequent day, she doubles the distance she walked the previous day. How long is her walk? Answer: 10 miles.\nExplanation: Trish goes on a 1-mile walk on the first day. The next day, she goes on a 2-mile walk (2 x 1 = 2). The day after that, she goes on a 4-mile walk (2 x 2 = 4). The day after that, she goes on an 8-mile walk (4 x 2 = 8). And finally, the day after that, she goes on a 16-mile walk (8 x 2 = 16). So, in total, Trish goes on a walk that is 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 37 miles. But since she doubles the distance she walks each day, she ends up going 37 x 2 = 74 miles. And since a mile is about 5,280 feet, Trish ends up walking about 74 x 5,280 = 37,844 feet or about 37.84 miles.\n\nB. The answer is not accurate because the scenario does not specify that Trish is walking daily and doubling her distance every day for 5 days with 1 day of break.\n\nMy Answer: B. The answer is not accurate because the scenario does not specify that Trish went for a walk every day for five days with one day of rest, and that she doubled the distance of her walks each day. Instead, the scenario describes one walk of 1 mile on one day and does not provide any information about subsequent days. Therefore, it is not possible to accurately determine the total distance that Trish walked.", "n_output": -1}

Answer: 20 meters. Explanation: To find the length of the rope cut in the ratio of 2:3, we can use the fact that the two parts of the rope have a ratio of 2:3. This means that one part of the rope is twice as long as the other part. Since we know that the two parts of the rope total 40 meters, we can use algebra to solve for the length of one part of the rope. Let x be the length of one part of the rope, then the other part is 2x. The total length of the two parts is 2x + 2x = 4x = 40. Therefore, x = 10, meaning one part of the rope is 10 meters long and the other part is 2x = 30 meters long.", "n_output": -1}

{"ground truth": 10.0, "prediction": "Question: Olivia's insurance premium starts out at $50/month. It goes up 10% for every accident and $5/month for every ticket. What is the percentage increase for every accident? Answer: 5%. What is the percentage increase for every ticket? Answer: 5%.\n\nI think something is wrong with the problem description or the numbers provided.\n\nExplanation:\nThe percentage increase in insurance premium for every accident seems to be 5%. If Olivia gets in an accident and the insurance company increases her premium by 10%, the new premium will be $55/month ($50 + $5). If the insurance company increases the premium by another 10% for every additional accident, the new premium will be $60/month. Therefore, the percentage increase for every accident is 5% (60 - 55) / 55 = 0.05 or 5%.\n\nThe percentage increase in insurance premium for every ticket seems to be 5%. If Olivia gets a ticket and the insurance company increases her premium by $5, the new premium will be $55/month. If the insurance company increases the premium by another $5 for every additional ticket, the new premium will be $60/month. Therefore, the percentage increase for every ticket is 5% (60 - 55) / 55 = 0.05 or 5%.", "n_output": -1}

The fourth dig site was twice as old as the third dig site. The archaeologist studied the fourth dig site\u2019s relics and gave the site a date of 8400 BC. What is the date given to the fourth dig site by the archaeologist? Answer: 8400 BC\n\nIf the first dig site is 352 years more recent than the second dig site, and the third dig site is 3700 years older than the first dig site, then we can use the following equation to find the date of the second dig site:\n\nSecond Dig Site \u2192 T2 = First Dig Site \u2192 T1 + 3700 years\n\nWe also know that the third dig site is 3700 years older than the first dig site, which means that the first dig site is 3700 years older than the third dig site.

Answer: 13 students took part in the math competition. Explanation: To find out how many students took part in the math competition, we can use the information that one-third of the class took part in the competition. We can do this by first finding out the total number of students in the class, and then multiplying that number by one-third.\n\nSo, if we call the total number of students in the class \"n\", we can set up the equation:\n\nn \u00d7 (1/3) = 13\n\nWe can then solve this equation to find that the total number of students in the class is 39.

How many fish does Hershel have remaining in the bowl after gifting his sister half of them? Answer: 4 betta fish and 14 goldfish.\n\nI don't understand what Hershel's initial number of fish is in the bowl, how did you come up with 10 betta fish and 15 goldfish in a bowl?\n\nCan you please explain the solution step by step?\n\nAnswer: Sure, I'd be happy to explain the solution step by step!\n\nLet's first determine the total number of fish that Hershel has in the bowl. We know that Bexley brings him 2/5 times as many betta fish as he already has, so the total number of betta fish should be 10 + 2/5 \\* 10 = 12 betta fish.\n\nSimilarly, we know that Bexley brings him 1/3 times as many goldfish as he already has, so the total number of goldfish should be 15 + 1/3 \\* 15 = 20 goldfish.\n\nTherefore, the total number of fish in the bowl is 12 betta fish and 20 goldfish, or a total of 32 fish.\n\nNow, let's determine the number of fish that Hershel gifts to his sister. Since he gifts her \"half\" of his fish, we know that the number of betta fish he gives her is half the total number of betta fish, which is equal to 12 betta fish.\n\nThe total number of fish therefore becomes the number of remaining in the bowl, which is equal to the total number of fish minus the number of fish given to his sister.\n\nIn this case, the number of fish remaining in the bowl is the total number of fish minus the number of fish given to his sister, which is 32 fish - 12 betta fish, which is equal to 20 goldfish.\n\nHence, Hershel has 4 betta fish and 20 goldfish remaining in the bowl after gifting his sister half of his fish.\n\nI hope that helps explain the solution step by step!", "n_output": -1}

So, Nina's scholarship is worth $1000 less than Kelly's.\n\nAnswer: C.\n\nExplanation:\nLet's denote the amount of scholarship received by Kelly, Wendy and Nina by K, W and N respectively.\nFrom the given information, we have:\nK = 2W ( Equation 1)\nN = 8000 - 1000 ( Equation 2)\nSubstituting K in equation 1 with the value obtained from equation 2, we get:\nK = 2 \\* ( 8000 - 1000 ) = 16000\nSo, Kelly's scholarship is worth $16000.\nSubtracting Nina's scholarship of $1000 less than Kelly's, we get:\nK - 1000 = 16000\n=> K = 15000\nSo, Kelly's scholarship is worth $15000.\nHence, Nina's scholarship is worth $1000 less than Kelly's, which is C", "n_output": -1}

{"ground truth": 2.0, "prediction": "Question: In 5 years, Frank will be three times as old as Ty is now. Ty is currently 4 years more than two times as old as Carla is now. Carla is currently 2 years older than Karen is now. How many years older is Carla currently than Karen is now? Answer: 3 years.\n\nCan you explain the solution process?\n\nAnswer: Certainly! The solution process for this problem can be broken down into three steps:\n\n1. Find the present age of Ty by subtracting the given age of 5 years from the present age of Carla, who is currently 2 years older than Karen. Therefore, Ty's present age is 5 - 2 = 3 years.\n2. Determine Carla's present age by adding 2 years to Ty's present age. Therefore, Carla's present age is 3 + 2 = 5 years.\n3. Determine the age difference between Carla and Karen in 5 years from now using the information that Carla is currently 2 years older than Karen and the fact that Karen's age will not change in the future. Therefore, the age difference in 5 years will be 2 - 2 = 0 years.\n4. Finally, subtract Frank's future age from Ty's present age to get the number of years that Frank will be older than Ty in the future. Since Frank is currently three times as old as Ty, we can write Frank's future age as 3x, where x is the number of years that Ty's present age represents. Substituting 3 and 3 into the equation we have x = 3, so Frank's future age is 3 \\* 3 = 9 years.\n5. Finally, we can subtract Frank's future age of 9 years from Ty's present age of 3 years to get the number of years that Ty will be older than Frank in the future future. Thus, Ty will be 3 years older than Frank in 5 years.", "n_output": -1}

How many more Muscovy ducks are there than Cayugas? Answer: 3 more.\n\nExplanation: The statements in the question can be represented mathematically as:\n\n* Let X be the total number of Cayugas, then the number of Muscovy ducks is X + 4\n* Let Y be the total number of Khaki Campbell ducks, then twice the number of Cayugas is 2Y\n* So, the number of Muscovy ducks is 3 more than the number of Cayugas, which is X + 4\n* The number of Muscovy ducks is also 3 less than twice the number of Cayugas, which is 2Y\n* Solving this set of inequalities gives X + 4 = 2Y or 2Y - 3 = X + 4\n* Since both the above equations are true, we can say that X = 2Y - 3\n* Substituting X = 2Y - 3 in the equation X + 4 = 2Y gives 2Y - 3 + 4 = 2Y, which simplifies to 6Y = 7Y, which is true.\n* Thus, the number of Muscovy ducks is 3 more than the number of Cayugas, which is 2Y - 3, so the answer is 3.", "n_output": -1}

{"ground truth": 20.0, "prediction": "Question: Mrs. Choi purchased a house for $80000. Five years later, she sold it for a 20% profit and got a 5% broker's commission from the original price. What was the percentage profit when she sold it five years later? Answer: 25/(100+20+5) = 0.25/125 = 20%\n\nLesson: When you sell an investment, the percentage profit is calculated by taking the profit you made on the sale and expressing it as a percentage of the original investment cost. In this problem, we can write an equation to represent the situation. Let x be the original investment cost, y be the profit made on the sale, and k be the broker's commission as a decimal. Then we have x + y - k = 80000, which represents the fact that the total amount received from the sale was the original investment cost plus the profit minus the commission. Solving this equation, we can find that y = 0.25x/100, which expresses the fact that the percentage profit is equal to 20% of the original investment cost.\n\nExample:\n\nIf x = 80000, then y = 0.25x/100 = 2000. If x = 100000, then y = 0.25x/100 = 2500. If x = 200000, then y = 0.25x/100 = 5000.\n\nWord Bank:\nProfit, property, commission, equation, investment, cost, profitpercentage, sale, sell, original price\n\nVocabulary\n\n1. investment: the act of committing money or resources to a particular undertaking with the aim of making a profit\n2. cost: the amount of money paid or required to purchase or rent something\n3. profit: an increase in financial gain or revenue earned as a result of a business or venture\n4. percentage: a fraction or ratio in numbers expressing a proportion as a/b or b/a or 100a/b\n5. commission: compensation payment or recompense for service or work or labor or an agent or broker involved in a transaction\n6. equation: a mathematical statement relating two or more than two variables to each other\n7. original price: the amount of money asked or paid or required for something the first time\n8. property: a holding or belonging to a person or", "n_output": -1}

{"ground truth": 2.0, "prediction": "Question: Dina has twice as many dolls as Ivy. 2/3 of Ivy's dolls are collectors editions. What fraction of Ivy's dolls are collectors editions? Answer: 2/9.  \n-----\n\nIn the phrase \"2/3 of Ivy's dolls\", the expression \"2/3\" is being used as a shorthand notation for \"2 thirds\" or \"two thirds\". This is a common way of expressing a ratio or fraction. For example, if someone said \"I have 5/8 of a pie,\" they would mean that they have 5 parts out of 8 possible parts. In the same way, when it is said \"2/3 of Ivy's dolls are collectors editions\" it means that 2/3 of the dolls which belong to Ivy are collectors editions.\n\nIt's important to remember that ratios and fractions can be written in many different ways. The numbers on the top and bottom of the fraction can change, and the line between them can be either a horizontal line (as in the example \"2/3\") or a diagonal line (as in the example \"2 - 3\").\n\nIt's also important to remember that in a sentence, it is not necessary to say \"of\" or \"the\" before the fraction, if it is clear by the context of the sentence.\nIn this example \"2/3\" or \"two thirds\" are both correct and mean the same thing.\n\nQuestion: 7*5 + 2*3 is equal to?  \nAnswer: 7*3 + 2*5\n\nIn this question, the numbers on the top and bottom of the algebraic expression \"7*5 + 2*3\" are being added together in a specific order and the expression.\nIn the first expression 7*5 = 35\nand in the second expression 2*3 = 6\nThen the sum of these two expression 35+6=41\nit means the final result 7*5 + 2*3 is equal to 41\n\nIt's important to remember that in an algebraic expression like this one, the numbers on top and bottom of the expression are being added together in a specific order and the expression and that order and the numbers", "n_output": -1}

Han visited 2 less than twice as many rehabilitation centers as Jude did. Jude visited half fewer rehabilitation centers as Lisa did. How many rehabilitation centers did Han visit? Answer: 5 Han visited 5 rehabilitation centers.\n\nHowever, in the solution process, it is not clear why Lisa visited fewer rehabilitation centers than Jane and Han visited. It would make more sense to say that Lisa visited half as many rehabilitation centers as Hannah did, which would be 10.5 because 5 + 2 = 7. Additionally, the text does not mention anything about Lisa visiting any rehabilitation centers, so her number of visits is not even mentioned in the story. This makes the solution incomprehensible because there is no explanation given for why Lisa is included in the arithmetic structure of the problem or why the text does not mention anything about her visiting any rehabilitation centers. Therefore, the solution presented is not satisfactory for the reasons given above.", "n_output": -1}

The difference represents the number of collector's edition dolls that Ivy has. Since she has twice as many dolls as Dina, the number of collector's edition dolls she has is half of the total number of collector's edition dolls.

How many calories does he burn every day? Answer: 7500 calories per day. Explanation: On a daily basis, Jonathan consumes 2500 calories and burns 3000 calories, resulting in a net energy expenditure of 500 calories. Over the course of a week, including Saturday, Jonathan consumes a total of 2500 \\*7 = 17,500 calories. He burns a total of 3000 \\*7 = 21,000 calories. Therefore, the total energy expenditure for the week is 21,000 - 17,500 = 17,500 calories. This means that Jonathan burns 1000 calories per day on average. However, since he consumes more calories on Saturday than the rest of the week, his average daily energy expenditure for the week is 1000 calories per day + 2500 calories per day = 3500 calories per day. This is the answer choice (C). Since, however, Jonathan meets his energy needs primarily by consuming a diet that provides approximately 90 of his daily energy expenditure and does not supplement his diet with additional energy, it can be inferred that he is not expending an additional 400 calories per day on average.", "n_output": -1}

How many native trees does the forest already have? Answer: 30\n\nExplanation: The forest had 30 native trees before Monday, and the total number of trees in the forest tripled on Monday, so there are now 90 trees in the forest (30 + 60). On Tuesday, the forester planted a third of the number of trees he planted on Monday, so he planted 20 trees (1/3 \\* 60 = 20). Since the forester only planted 20 new trees, not 30, the total number of trees in the forest is still 90 (30 + 60 + 20 = 110). The forest already had 30 native trees, so there are now 80 non-native trees in the forest (110 - 30 = 80).", "n_output": -1}

He wants to sell the tomatoes for $6 per 1 kilogram but 3 kilograms of tomatoes were rotten. How much does he want to sell the tomatoes for per 1 kilogram? Answer: 33.33\n\nExplanation to the solution:\n\nTo find the price per 1 kilogram of tomatoes, we need to first calculate the total weight of the tomatoes and subtract the weight of the rotten tomatoes. The total weight of the tomatoes is 20 kilograms, and 3 kilograms of tomatoes were rotten, so the total weight of the remaining tomatoes is 20-3= <<20-3=17>>17 kilograms.\n\nSo the price per 1 kilogram of tomatoes is $6 (the desired price) / (17 kilograms (the total weight of the remaining tomatoes)) = $6 / 17 = $<<6/17=35.29>>35.29.\n\nHowever, since cents cannot be used in the solution, we need to round this price up to the nearest cent. Therefore, the price per 1 kilogram of tomatoes that Tommy wants to sell them for is $36. This is the solution to the problem.", "n_output": -1}

What percentage of the pizza did Pete eat? Answer: 75%. Explanation: To find Pete's share of the pizza, we first need to find the total number of slices left after Stephen ate his share. Since 100% - 25% = 75%, the total number of slices left is 75% of the total number of slices, which is 75/12 = <<75/12=6.25>>6.25 slices. Since there are 12 slices per pizza, Pete ate 6.25/12 = <<6.25/12=0.50>>0.50 pizzas. Therefore, Pete ate 50% of the pizza.", "n_output": -1}

District 3 has 303 + 2 = 325 voters.\n\nSince there are 322 + 323 + 303 + 325 = 1379 voters in the districts, and the sum of the districts is not mentioned in the problem, we can assume that there are 4 districts.\n\nWe know that District 1, District 2, and District 3 exist, and we know that District 1 has the least number of voters, so the other two districts must have more than 322 voters. Since District 3 has twice as many voters as District 1, the middle district, which we'll call District 2, has 322 + 2 = 324 voters.\n\nSince we know that there are 5 districts, and we've accounted for 3 of them, the other two districts must each have 324 - 1 = 323 and 324 - 2 = 322 voters respectively. Therefore, there are 5 districts, and they are:\n\n1. 322 voters in District 1.\n2. 323 voters in District 2.\n3. 324 voters in District 3.\n4. 324 voters in District X.\n5. 323 voters in District Y.", "n_output": -1}

How many friends does Boyd have in total? Answer: 100\n\nExplanation: The total number of friends that Boyd has is 80 (Julian's number of friends) + 60% (the proportion of Julian's friends who are boys) = 100. Since 60% of Julian's friends are boys, the other 40% are girls. Boyd has twice as many friends who are girls as Julian does, so the number of girls that Boyd has friends with is 2 \\* (the number of girls that Julian has friends with) = 2 \\* 40% (the proportion of Julian's friends who are girls) = 80% = 80. Since 60% of Julian's friends are boys and 40% are girls, the total number of boys and girls that Boyd has friends with is 80 + 80 = 160. Since 60% of Julian's friends are boys and 50% of the total number of friends that Boyd has are boys, the number of girls that Boyd has friends with is 40 + 40% = 48.

Answer: 1/10.\n\nI don't understand how he could have sold 1/10 of his share if he only owned 1/2 of a lot. Can you explain this? Thank you.\n\n--Rosalyn\n\nAnswer:\n\nYou are correct that the statement \"A man owned 1/2 of a lot\" does not provide enough information to determine the fraction of his share that he sold. In order to determine the fraction of his share that he sold, we would need additional information.\n\nFor example, we would need to know the total value of the lot, the price at which the man sold his share, and the size of the man's share of the lot. With this information, we can use the following steps to calculate the fraction of the man's share that he sold:\n\n1. Determine the value of the man's total share of the lot.\nTo do this, we can first multiply the value of the man's 1/2 share of the lot by the number of shares in the lot. For example, if the lot has 10 shares, the value of the man's 1/2 share of the lot would be (1/2) x (1/10) x (10) = 500. If the lot has a different number of shares, we would need to use a different value for the man's 1/2 share in order to calculate the man's total share value.\n2. Determine the price at which the man sold his share.\nWe are given that the man sold his 1/10 share for the amount of $460. Therefore, this was the price at which he sold his share.\n3. Calculate the fraction of man's share that he sold.\nWe can use the following formula to calculate the fraction of the man's share that he sold:\n\n Fraction of share sold = (Value of share sold / Value of total share) x (Number of shares in lot / Number of shares in man's share)\n\nIf we use the values we have been given, we can plug these values into the formula to get:\n\n Fraction of share sold = (460 / 500) x (1/10 / 1) = 0.92 x 1/1 = 0.", "n_output": -1}

{"ground truth": 2.0, "prediction": "Question: In five years, Grant will be 2/3 the age of the hospital that he is hired into. What fraction of the age of the hospital will Grant be in five years? Answer: 1/3\n\nExplanation: In five years, Grant will be 2/3 the age of the hospital that he is hired into. This means that in the present time, the ratio of Grant's age to the hospital's age is 2/3. If we let x be the age of the hospital, then we can write the ratio as 2/3 = 2x/3. Solving for x, we find that x = 3, so the hospital is currently 3 years old. In five years, Grant will be 2/3 the age of the hospital at the time he is hired. Since the hospital is currently 3 years old, in five years it will be 8/3 years old. Grant will be 2/3 of 8/3, which gives us 10/3. Therefore, Grant will be 1/3 the age of the hospital in five years. Answer: \\boxed{1/3}.", "n_output": -1}

How much do you spend on a single box of cereal and a single box of crackers if you buy x of each?

Once you have the ratio, multiply it by the measure to get the answer.\n\nExample:\nIf a person runs 5 miles per hour, how many miles does the person run in 2 hours.\nThe ratio is 5 miles/1 hour\nMultiply the ratio by the measure of the unit, in this case is 2 hours, thus 5 miles/hour\\*2 hours = 10 miles\n\nIn the first question Luke catch 2 fish per day for 30 days, and we know he catch 2 fish per day.\nWe don't know how many fish per day he catch them, he could catch them each hour, which would equal 2 fish/day \\* day= 2 fish/day\\*30 =60 fish\n\nIn the second question the store sells 2 toys per minute, and we know it sells 10 toys in 5 minutes.\nThis would mean the store sells 2 toys/minute\\*5 minutes=10 toys.\n\nIn third question the store sells 2 fish per day for 30 days, and we know it sells 10 fish per day.\nWe don't know how many fish per day he sells them, he could sell them each day, which would equal 2 fish/day \\* day= 2 fish/day*30 =60 fish.", "n_output": -1}

Answer: 8.\n\nThis seems like a simple problem, but it has a hidden trap. If you use algebra and draw diagrams, you'll find that there are different answers depending on how you approach it.\n\nSome students might say that each pizza had 8/5 = 1-1/5 slices.\n\nOthers might say that each pizza had 3/5 pizza = 3 slices.\n\nBut the correct answer is 8 slices. Can you show that all of these answers are incorrect?\n\nAnswer: To show that these answers are incorrect, we need to use a logical approach to the problem. We know that each pizza has 8 slices, and we can infer that each pizza also has 3/5 pizza, since each pizza is made up of 3/5 of a whole pizza.\n\nHowever, if we divide the number of slices on each pizza by the number of pizzas, we get 8/5 = 1-1/5 = 4-1/5, which is not equal to 8. This means that the answer 8 slices cannot be incorrect, since it is the only answer that is the same for both the number of pizzas and the number of slices on each pizza.", "n_output": -1}

{"ground truth": 16.0, "prediction": "Question: Michael is stuck in an elevator that is slowly moving to the bottom floor. The elevator needs to move down 20 floors to reach the bottom. It takes 15 minutes for the elevator to travel down the first half of the floors. The elevator then takes 5 minutes per floor to travel down the next 5 floors. It then takes 16 minutes per floor for the elevator to finish traveling down the final 5 floors. How many minutes does it take for the elevator to finish traveling down each floor? Answer: 30 minutes\nTo find the total time it takes to travel down the first 10 floors, add together the time it takes to travel down the first 5 floors (15 minutes / 2 floors = 7.5 minutes per floor) and the time it takes to travel down the next 5 floors (5 minutes per floor). This gives a total time of 7.5 + 25 = 32.5 minutes.\nTo find the total time it takes to travel down the last 5 floors, divide the time it takes to travel one floor (16 minutes per floor) by the number of floors left to travel (5 floors). This gives a total time of 16 / 5 = 3.2 minutes.\nTo find the total time it takes to travel down all 20 floors, add together the times it takes to travel the first 10 floors (32.5 minutes), the last 5 floors (3.2 minutes), and the remaining 5 floors (15 minutes / 1 floor). This gives a total time of 32.5 + 3.2 + 15 = 50.7 minutes.\nSince the elevator is moving at a constant speed, the total time it takes to travel down each floor is the same as the total time it takes to travel down all 20 floors. Therefore, it takes 50.7 minutes (or 16.925 clock hours) to travel down each floor of the building. Answer: \\box{50.7}.", "n_output": -1}

Explanation: Since 2/5 the number of tables in the class are on top of each table, therefore the number of tables in the class is equal to 2/5 times the number of tables in the class. But since 1/2 the number of tables in the class are on top of each table, therefore the number of tables in the class is equal to 1/2 the number of tables in the class. In other words, the number of tables in the class is the same as the number of tables in the class, but because we divided the number of tables in the class by 2 and then divided it again by 2, the result is 1/4 the number of tables in the class.

How many homes does the town of Belize have? Answer: 200. Can you explain?\n\nAnswer: Sure!\n\nIt's important to understand that the town of Belize has a total of 400 homes, as this is given in the problem statement.\n\nThen, we're told that one fourth of the town's homes are white. This can be written as:\n\n1/4 \\* 400 = 100 white homes\n\nSo, out of the 400 homes in Belize, 100 of them are white.\n\nNext, we're told that one fifth of the non-white homes have a fireplace. We can rewrite this as:\n\n1/5 \\* (400 - 100) = 200 homes with fireplaces.\n\nThis expression tells us that 1/5 of the 300 non-white homes in Belize (since we already know that 100 of them are white) have a fireplace. When we substitute the values, we obtain 200 homes with fireplaces.\n\nFinally, to solve the problem, we need to find out how many non-white homes there are in Belize. We're given this information in the form of 1/5, so we can substitute it in:\n\n300 = 5n\n\nWe can then solve for n:\n\n300/5 = 60\n\n60 x 5 = 300\n\nn = 300/60\n\nn = 5\n\nSo, there are 5 non-white homes in Belize, and we know that out of these 5 homes, 200 have fireplaces. We can then add both of these values to find the total number of homes in Belize:\n\n200 + 5 = 205\n\nTherefore, the town of Belize has 205 homes. I hope this explanation helps!", "n_output": -1}

This means that there are 50% more yellow marbles than green marbles.\n\nWe also know that there are 12 yellow marbles. Since there are 50% more yellow marbles than green marbles, there must be 50% / 2 = 25% fewer green marbles than yellow marbles.\n\nSince there are already 12 yellow marbles, and we have to subtract 25% from 12 to get the number of yellow marbles, we get 12 - (25% of 12) = 12 - 3 = 9.\n\nThus, there are 9 green marbles.

{"ground truth": 30.0, "prediction": "Question: A pole is 20 meters long. It got cut in a way that left it 30% shorter. What percentage shorter did it get cut? Answer: 7.5 meters (30% of 20 meters is 6 meters, and 30% of 6 meters is 1.8 meters, which is the length of the remaining pole after the first cut). Explanation: Since the pole was already cut in a way that left it 30% shorter, it means that 30% of the original length was cut off. To find out how much shorter the pole was cut, we can multiply the percentage of the original length that was cut off by the original length. If the original length is x meters, then the length that was cut off is (percentage of original length) \\* x meters. In this case, the remaining length of the pole is (30% \\* 20 meters) = 6 meters, So the pole was originally 20 meters long, and after the first cut it was 6 meters long. To find out how much shorter the pole was cut, we can subtract the original length of the pole that was cut off from the original length. So the pole was originally 20 meters long and after the first cut 30% of the original length was cut off, which is 6 meters long.", "n_output": -1}

In the end, all non-defective units were sold. How many units did customer A buy? Answer: 27. Can you explain why is that the answer is correct?\n\nAnswer: The total number of non-defective units after the defective units were removed is 20-5=<<20-5=15>>15.\nThus the total number of units that customer A, B, and C bought is 15.\nSince customer A bought 3 units, customer B bought X units, and customer C bought 7 units, and all non-defective units were sold, we can write the equation:\n3+X=15\nThis equation represents the total number of units sold to the three customers, with X representing the number of units sold to customer B. To solve for X, we can subtract 3 from both sides of the equation, which gives us:\nX=12\nThus, customer B bought 12 units.\nSince the total number of units that customer A, B, and C bought is 15, the number of units customer A bought is:\nA=15-12=3\nThus, customer A bought 3 units.

Answer: 5. \n\nThe formula used in the book is:\n\nThe cost of the coat / The cost of the shirt = 5 (answer)\n\nExplanation:\nTo determine the cost of the coat in terms of the cost of the shirt, we can set up the following equation:\n\nCs = Cp + Cc\n\nwhere Cs is the cost of the coat, Cp is the cost of the pants, and Cc is the cost of the coat.\n\nSince the cost of the pants and shirt is $100, we can substitute this value into the equation and solve for Cc, the cost of the coat:\n\n$100 = Cp + $244\n\nCc = $244 - $100 = $144\n\nSo, the cost of the coat is $144, and the cost of the coat is 5 times the cost of the shirt:\n\nCc = 5(Cs)\n\nCc = 5($144)\n\nCc = $720\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nThe cost of the coat is 5 times the cost of the shirt, or Cc = 5(Cs).", "n_output": -1}

How many miles did Michelle ride from her office to her home? Answer: 4 miles. Michelle rode the taxi from her office to her home, which is a distance of 4 miles. This can be determined by dividing the fare by the fare per mile and multiplying the result by 2. That is, the fare is $2 and the fare per mile is $2/mile. Therefore, Michelle rode 4 miles by dividing 2 by 2/mile and then multiplying the result by 2. \n\nIf you are trying to determine the fare of a taxi ride, you can divide the distance by the fare per mile and then multiply the result by the number of miles. For example, if the distance is 8 miles and the fare per mile is 2/mile, the fare is 8\\*2 = $16. \n\nIf you know the fare and the distance, you can calculate the fare per mile by dividing the fare by the distance and then multiplying the result by 100. For example, if the fare is $10 and the distance is 6 miles, the fare per mile is $10/6 or $1.67/mile. \n\nIf you know the fare per mile and the number of miles, you can calculate the distance by multiplying the number of miles by the fare per mile. For example, if the fare per mile is $1 and the number of miles is 7, the distance is 7\\*$1/mile = 7 miles. \n\nIf you know the distance, that is the most important number that will help you determine the fare of a taxi ride.

{"ground truth": 100.0, "prediction": "Question: John cuts his grass to 2 inches. It grows .5 inches per month. When it gets to 4 inches he cuts it back down to 2 inches. It cost $100 to get his grass cut. How much did it cost to get his grass cut? Answer: 100 dollars\nIt sounds like you are describing a scenario where John has his grass cut on a regular basis, but he only cuts it back to 2 inches when it grows to 4 inches. This means that the grass is not being allowed to grow to its full height before it is cut, which is likely not the best approach for maintaining a healthy lawn. In general, it's best to cut grass when it is dry and to mow it to a height of 2-3 inches. This allows the grass to store energy in its roots, which helps it to recover more quickly after mowing and keeps it healthier overall. If you want to keep your grass looking its best, you should try to mow it more frequently, but at a higher height, rather than cutting it back to 2 inches all the time.", "n_output": -1}

{"ground truth": 10.0, "prediction": "Question: Mr. Grey's house was worth $100,000. He sold the house to Mr. Brown at a profit of 10%. After one year, Mr. Brown sold the house to his other friend with a 10% loss. What was the percentage loss when Mr. Brown sold the house to his friend? Answer: 10%.\n\nCan you explain why there is a 10% loss when Mr. Brown sold the house to his friend? Brown bought the house when the market price is higher than the original value, and then he sold it when the market price drop. Since the selling price is lower than the buying price, it results in a loss. Since the loss percentage is the same as the profit percentage when he bought the house, it means that the house price didn't change much in a year, and it's simply a bad time to sell the house.\n\nQuestion: In a group of 10 students, the average height is 5.8 feet. If one student is added whose height is 6.2 feet, what will the new average height be? Answer: 5.97 feet.\n\nCan you explain why the new average height will be 5.97 feet? When one student is added, the total height of all students will increase, so the average height will decrease. Since new total height is 60.2 feet and there are 10 students, so the new average height will be 60/10=6 feet. Since the new height is 6.2 feet, it will increase the total height by 6.2/10=0.62 feet, so the new average height will be 5.97 feet.\n\nQuestion: The average of 5 numbers is 7. If one number is added which is 9, what will be the new average? Answer: 7.\n\nCan you explain why the new average will be 7? When one number is added, the total will increase, so the average will decrease. Since total will be 5+9=14 and there are 5 numbers, so the new average will be 14/5=2.8 feet. Since, the first average is 7, the new average will become 2.8-7=-5.2 feet. It is not a real number, so the new average will be 7.", "n_output": -1}

Then, a^p + b^p = (a+b)^p.\n\nProof:\n\nSince gcd(a,p)=gcd(b,p)=1, we can find integers x and y such that a = px + 1 and b = py + 1, where x and y are relatively prime. Then we have:\n\na^p = (px + 1)^p = px^p + px^(p-1) + ... + px^2 + px + 1 = px^p + px + 1\nb^p = (py + 1)^p = py^p + py^(p-1) + ... + py^2 + py + 1 = py^p + py + 1\n(a+b)^p = (px+y)^p = px^p + px^{p-1} + ... + px + y = px^p + px^{p-1} + ... + px + y\n\nTherefore, we have:\n\na^p + b^p = (a+b)^p - px^p - py^p\n(a+b)^p - px^p - py^p = a^p + b^p\n\nMultiplying both sides by p, we have:\n\npx^p + py^p - px^p - py^p = p(a^p + b^p)\npx + py - px - py = a + b\n\nSo, a+b is relatively prime to p, and we have:\n\na^p + b^p = (a+b)^p", "n_output": -1}

He added 2 more, but they ate 6 of his original fish before he could remove them and take them back to the store. He exchanged them for 3 new fish. How many new fish did he exchange them for? Answer: 3.\n\nExplanation: To solve this problem, you need to add up the number of fish that Jonah had before and after the exchange. First, add 14 (the number of fish he started with) to 2 (the number of new fish he added) to find out how many fish he had after adding the two new fish: 14 + 2 = 16.\n\nThen, subtract 6 (the number of fish that the new fish ate) from 16 to find out how many fish he had left after the new fish ate some of his original fish: 16 - 6 = 10.\n\nFinally, subtract the number of fish he started with (14) from the number of fish he had left (10) to find out how many new fish he received: 14 - 10 = 4.

{"ground truth": 2.5, "prediction": "Question: Daria consumes 2.5 times the amount of pizza that Don does. What is the ratio of pizza consumption between Daria and Don? Answer: 2.5:1\n\nExplanation: Let's suppose that Daria consumes x slices of pizza and Don consumes y slices. The question states that Daria consumes 2.5 times the amount of pizza that Don does, which can be written as x = 2.5y. To find the ratio of pizza consumption between Daria and Don, we can set up a proportion:\n\nx/(2.5y) = 1/(2.5y)\n\nSolving this proportion gives us x/(2.5y) = 1/2.5y, which can be rearranged into x = 4y. Therefore, Daria consumes 4 times the amount of pizza that Don does. The ratio of pizza consumption between Daria and Don is 4:1.\n\nQuestion: A train traveling at 70 mph departs from New York to Los Angeles 3 hours after a train traveling at 60 mph departs from Los Angeles to New York. What is the distance covered by the train from New York to Los Angeles if the train travels nonstop? Answer: 2240 miles\n\nExplanation: Let's call the distance between New York and Los Angeles x. The distance between Los Angeles and New York that the train traveling at 70 mph will have covered by the time it arrives is found by multiplying the distance between the two cities by the time it takes for the train to travel that distance divided by the speed of the train. That is:\n\nx = (3*240)= 720 miles\n\nThe distance between Los Angeles and New York that the train traveling at 60 mph will have covered by the time it arrives is found by multiplying the distance between the two cities by the time it takes for the train to travel that distance divided by the speed of the train. That is:\n\nx = (3*240)= 720 miles\n\nSince the distance between New York and Los Angeles is the same for both trains, the distance between Los Angeles and New York that the train traveling at 70 mph will have covered by the time it arrives is less than the distance between Los Angeles and New York that the train traveling at 60 mph will have covered by the time it arrives:\n", "n_output": -1}

Since Brooke does three times as many jumping jacks as Sidney, the total number of jumping jacks that Brooke does is three times the total number of jumping jacks that Sidney does.\n\nWe can use this information to find the total number of jumping jacks that Sidney does over the course of the week. On Monday, Sidney does 20 jumping jacks, so the total number of jumping jacks that he does by Thursday is 20 + 36 + 40 + 50 = 146.\n\nSince Brooke does three times as many jumping jacks as Sidney, the total number of jumping jacks that Brooke does is 146 \\* 3 = 438.\n\nTherefore, the number of jumping jacks that Sidney does on Monday is 20, and the number of jumping jacks that Brooke does is 438.\n\nList of Missing Numbers:\n\n1.

After two years, the price stabilized and finally fell by 20% from what it has risen. By how much did the price finally fall after stabilizing? Answer: 20%\n\nExplanation:\n\nInitially, the price of RAM increased by 30% due to the fire outbreak in the factory.

The weekend rental rate is $540 per day. They all decide to split the rental evenly. What is the weekend rental rate per day? Answer: 5.\n\nThere are many different ways to approach this question. One possible way is to use system of linear equations.\n\nLet x be the weekday rental rate per day and y be the weekend rental rate per day. Then we know that\n\n2x + 5y = 420 (given)\n(since there are 5 people in total and they split the rental evenly)\n\nWe also know that\n\nx + y = 540 (given)\n\nWe can rearrange the equations to solve for y as follows:\n\nx + y = 540\n2x + 5y = 420\n\nSubstitute x + y = 540 into the second equation:\n\n2x + 5y = 420\n2x + 5y = 420\n\nSubstitute x + y = 540 into the first equation:\n\n2x + 5y = 540\n3x + 5y = 540\n\nSince x and y must be integers, we can divide both sides by 3:\n\nx + y = 173.33...\n\nRounding down to the nearest integer, we find that\n\nx + y = 172\n\nSo the weekday rental rate per day is x = 172 and the weekend rental rate per day is y = 5y = 4.", "n_output": -1}

The first runs at an average pace of 8 minutes per mile, while the second runs at an average pace of 7 minutes per mile. After 56 minutes, the second runner stops for a drink of water. How many minutes did it take for the second runner to stop for a drink of water? Answer: 56/58  = 96.4%\n\nAnswer:\nIf the second runner stops for a drink of water after 56 minutes, the total time it would take for both runners to complete the 10-mile race is the sum of the time taken by each runner, or 56 + 56 = 112 minutes.\n\nSince both runners have been running for the same amount of time, the fraction of the race completed by the second runner when it stopped for a drink of water is 56/112, or approximately 0.57.\n\nTherefore, the total time taken by both runners to complete the 10-mile race is 112 minutes, and the time taken by the second runner to stop for a drink of water is 56/0.57 = 96.4%.\n\nSo, it took 96.4% of the total time taken by both runners to complete the 10-mile race for the second runner to stop for a drink of water.

How much weight of the rice and sugar was lost while carrying the goods to the store? Answer: 20 kg. Explanation: We can use the method of cross-multiplication. Let the weight of the green beans be x. Then 30 kg less than x is the weight of the rice and the weight of sugar is x + 10 kg. 1/3 of the weight of the rice is 20 kg less than x and 1/5 of the weight of sugar is 20 kg less than x + 10 kg.

Additionally, he will put a total of 500 silver coins and twice as many bronze coins as silver, all distributed equally across the chests. How many silver coins will he put in the chests? Answer: 100...\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe pirate has 3500 gold coins, which he will divide equally among the 5 chests, giving each chest 3500/5 = 700 gold coins.\n\nTo distribute the silver and bronze coins, the pirate first needs to determine how many of each type of coin he has. If he has twice as many bronze coins as silver coins, then he has 3500/5 = 700 silver coins and 700*2 = 1400 bronze coins.\n\nThe total number of silver and bronze coins is equal to 700+1400 = 2100 coins.\nSince the pirate wants to distribute these coins equally across the 5 chests, each chest will have 2100/5 = 420 coins.\nThus, the pirate will put 420 silver coins in the chests.

Answer: 3 and 4/5.\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Since Rupert is 3 and 1/2 times older than Peter, we can write:\n\t+ Rupert's age = 3.5x, where x is the number of years Rupert is older than Peter.\n\t+ Peter's age = 10 - 3.5x, because Peter is 10 years old and Rupert is 3.5x years older than him.\n* We can substitute Rupert's age expression into Peter's age expression and simplify to:\n\t+ 10 - 3.5x = 10 - 3.5 (10 - x)\n\t+ 10 - 3.5x = 10 - 3.5 (10 - 3.5x)\n\t+ x = 9\n* Finally, we substitute the value of x back into Rupert's age expression to find out Rupert's age:\n\t+ Rupert's age = 3.5(9)\n\t+ Rupert's age = 35\n* Thus, Rupert is 3 and 4/5 times older than Peter.", "n_output": -1}

{"ground truth": 60.0, "prediction": "Question: A class has 60 students. The number of students who bring their lunch is thrice the number of those who eat in the school cafeteria. The rest of the students don't eat lunch. How many students are there in the class? Answer: 20 students.\nAnswer: The correct answer is 20 students. Here's how we can solve the problem:\nLet's call the number of students who bring their lunch \"x\". The number of students who eat in the school cafeteria is \"x/3\". The number of students who don't eat lunch is \"60-x\".\nWe know that the sum of these three groups is equal to the number of students in the class, which is \"60\".\nThus, we have the equation:\nx + (x/3) + (60-x) = 60\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\nx + (x/3) = 20\nWe can substitute \"3x\" for \"x/3\" in the equation to get:\nx + (3x) = 20\nThis equation is equivalent to 3x^2 = 20, which has only one solution, which is x=10.\nThus, the number of students who bring their lunch is 10, the number of students who eat in the school cafeteria is 10/3=3, and the number of students who don't eat lunch is 60-10=50.\nSo the total number of students in the class is 60, which is equal to the number of students who bring their lunch + the number of students who eat in the school cafeteria + the number of students who don't eat lunch.\nSince the number of students who bring their lunch is 10, the number of students who eat in the school cafeteria is 10/3=3, and the number of students who don't eat lunch is 50, the number of students who bring their lunch is 10, the number of students who eat in the school cafeteria is 3, and the number of students who don't eat lunch is 50.\nTherefore, the answer is 20 students.", "n_output": -1}

How much money will his parents pay him for every extra chore he does during the week? Answer: 2 dollars\nAnswer: To find the total amount of money Edmund's parents will pay him for every extra chore, we must first find out how many extra chores he will have to do to earn $75. We know that 12 chores a week is his normal amount of chores, so he will have to do 75/2 = 37.5 extra chores in order to earn $75. Since he normally does 12 chores a week, he will have to do 12 + 37.5 = 49.5 chores in total. This means that his parents will pay him 49.5/12 = 4 extra chores.

{"ground truth": 3.0, "prediction": "Question: A small pizza can gives 4 slices, and a large pizza gives 8 slices. George purchased 3 small and 2 large pizzas. George would like to eat 3 pieces. His friend Bob would like to eat one more piece than George. Susie will eat half as many as Bob. Bill, Fred and Mark would each like 3 pieces. How many pieces would Bill, Fred, and Mark each like? Answer: 3\n\nExplanation:\nTo determine the number of pieces each person will receive, we first need to determine how many pieces there are in total. The three small pizzas each have 4 slices, so the total number of slices from the small pizzas is 4*3 = <<4*3=12>>12. The two large pizzas each have 8 slices, so the total number of slices from the large pizzas is 8*2 = <<8*2=16>>16. In total, there are 12+16 = <<12+16=28>>28 slices.\n\nTo determine how many slices each person will receive, we need to first give out all the slices from the large pizzas, as they each want one more piece than George. There are 16 slices from the large pizzas, and there are 4 people who want to eat them. Therefore, each person will receive 16/4 = <<16/4=4>>4 slices from the large pizzas.\n\nNow, we need to give out the slices from the small pizzas. There are 12 slices from the small pizzas, and there are 3 people who want to eat them. Therefore, each person will receive 12/3 = <<12/3=4>>4 slices from the small pizzas.\n\nNow that we know how many slices each person will receive, we can determine how many pieces they will receive.

{"ground truth": 4.0, "prediction": "Question: Steve has 25 socks. He has 4 pairs of socks that match, and all the others don't match. How many pairs of socks does he have that match? Answer: 4. Explanation: The word \"all\" implies that every one of the socks that doesn't match is included in the set of 25 socks. However, we can also infer from this statement that the set of socks that match is the complement of the set of socks that don't match. Since Steve has 4 pairs of socks that match, all of the socks in these pairs must be included in the set of socks that match. Since the set of socks that match is the complement of the set of socks that don't match, we can conclude that the number of pairs of socks that match is equal to the size of the set of socks that don't match. In this case, the set of socks that don't match has size 25 - 4 = 21, so the number of pairs of socks that match is 21/2 = 4 and 1/2 socks.", "n_output": -1}

How many milliliters is each drop? Answer: 6.67 milliliters per drop. Here is a breakdown of the calculations:\n\n* Let's first convert the rate of drips per minute to drops per minute: 3 drips per minute * 60 minutes = 180 drops per minute\n* Since each drop is 20 ml, the total volume of each minute of drips is 180 drops per minute * 20 ml/drop = 3600 ml per minute.\n* Since the pot holds 3 liters, the volume of the pot is 3 liters.\n* To find out how many milliliters each drop is, we divide the total volume of the drips in a minute by the volume of each drop: 3600 ml per minute / 20 ml per drop = 180 drops per minute * 3 liters / 20 ml/drop = 18000 ml/drop.\n* To get the answer in milliliters, we divide the volume of each drop in milliliters by the number of drops in a minute that can be represented by the volume of each drop, which is: 18000 ml/drop / 3 drops per minute = 6.67 ml/drop.\n\nSo each drop is 6.67 milliliters.", "n_output": -1}

How many chocolate chips is she going to add to the whole batch? Answer: 12\n\nExplanation: To find out how many chocolate chips Colleen is going to add to the whole batch, we need to find out how many M&Ms she's going to add. Since she's adding one-third as many M&Ms as chocolate chips, we can set up the proportion as follows:\n\nChocolate chips : M&Ms :: x : 3M\n\nSolving this proportion gives us:\n\nx : 3M = 12 : 10\n\nSo Colleen is going to add 12 / 10 = 1 1/10 or approximately 1.1 M&Ms to the whole batch. Since she's going to add one-third as many M&Ms as chocolate chips, she's going to add one-third of 1 1/10, or 1/3, to the whole batch.\n\nSince each M&M is worth 1 point and there are 12 chocolate chips in the batch, the total number of points Colleen's cookies will be worth is (12 x 1 point per chocolate chip) + (1/3 x 1 point per M&M) = 36 + 1/3 = 20 2/3 points.

Her twin sister Bonnie also collected cat stickers and had 63 in her collection. For their birthday, their grandparents gave them 25 cat stickers each. How many cat stickers did their grandparents give them for their birthday? Answer: 25 cat stickers each. Explanation: Add the number of cat stickers June had in her collection (76) to the number of cat stickers Bonnie had in her collection (63) and you get 139 + 63 = 202 cat stickers. So their grandparents gave them 202 cat stickers, which is twice as many cat stickers as they had in their collections.

He rearranged five of these boxes into packages of six highlighters each and sold them for $3 per package. He sold the rest of the highlighters separately at the rate of three pens for $2. What is the rate at which he sold the rest of the highlighters? Answer: 30 highlighters = $2.\n\nCan you give a step by step solution for this problem?\n\nAnswer: Yes, here is a step by step solution:\n\nStep 1: Calculate the total number of highlighters that Sam has\nSam bought 12 boxes of highlighters, and each box has 30 highlighters, so he bought a total of 12 \\* 30 = <<12\\*30=360>>360 highlighters.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the number of highlighters in the packages and the remaining highlighters\nSam combined five of the highlighter boxes to make packages of six highlighters each. The number of highlighters in each package is 30 highlighters / 6 = <<30/6=5>>5 highlighters. So, the number of highlighters in the packages is 5.\nThe number of highlighters remaining after making the packages is 360 - 5 = <<360-5=355>>355 highlighters.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the rate for selling the highlighters\nSam sold the packages of six highlighters each at the rate of $3 per package. To find the rate at which he sold the remaining highlighters, we need to find how many packages he had to sell at this rate. He had 355 highlighters remaining, and the package contained 5 highlighters, so he had to sell 355 / 5 = <<355/5=68>>68 packages.\nThus, the rate at which he sold the remaining highlighters is $3 per package, and the number of packages he had to sell is 68.

After 3 months, Mark digs up 4 strawberry plants and gives them to his friend. How many months did it take Mark to dig up the strawberry plants? Answer: 3\n\nExplanation: Mark must have waited for three months to harvest the strawberries, because after one month, there are two strawberry plants, after two months there are four strawberry plants, and after three months there are eight strawberry plants. This means that it took three months for the number of strawberry plants to double to eight. Therefore, it must have taken three months for Mark to dig up four strawberry plants.", "n_output": -1}
{"ground truth": 150.0, "prediction": "Question: Tom opens an amusement park. It cost $100,000 to open initially. It also cost 1% of that to run per day. He sells 150  tickets a day for $10 each. How many tickets does he sell a day? Answer: 150 tickets\n\nIn this problem, the total cost to open and run the amusement park is $100,000 + $100, which is $<<100000+100=100010>>100010.\n\nHe also sells 150 tickets a day for $10 each, which generates $10*150=<<10*150=1500>>1500 of revenue.\n\nSince the total cost to open and run the park is greater than the revenue generated by ticket sales, the park is likely to lose money, which is not sustainable in the long run.\n\nTherefore, in order to keep the park running and profitable, Tom needs to increase the number of tickets sold or decrease the cost of running the park.\n\nTo decrease the cost of running the park, one approach is to decrease the 1% cost of running the park\nTo increase the number of tickets sold, Tom can decrease the ticket price, or increase the number of visitors to the park.\n\nTherefore,\nthe number of tickets sold per day = 150 tickets\n\nand the number of visitors to the park is not given, so it is not possible to determine whether the amusement park is profitable or not.", "n_output": -1}

After another 20 minutes, she has completed twice as many problems. She has 40 minutes to complete the rest of the test. How many minutes does she have to complete the rest of the test? Answer: 50 minutes.\n\nExplanation: To find out how many minutes Georgia has to complete the rest of the test, we need to add up the number of minutes it takes her to complete each section. In the first 20 minutes, she completed 1 problem per minute, so she completed 1 \\* 20 = <<1+21-20**20>>10 problems.\n\nIn the next 20 minutes, she completed 2 problems per minute, so she completed 2 \\* 20 = <<2+18-22**20>>18 problems.\n\nSince she has already completed half the test, we can say that the total number of problems on the test is equal to the sum of the number of problems she has already completed plus the number of problems she still needs to complete. Therefore, the total number of problems on the test is 10 + 18 = <<10+18-8**20}}{{10+18-8}}18.\n\nWe have 18 problems to complete in the last 40 minutes. Therefore, Georgia has a total of 40 + 18 = <<40+18-8**20}}{{40+18-8}}40 minutes to complete the rest of the test.\n\nSince Maria has 40 minutes to complete the rest of the test, and she will complete half the test in the first 40 minutes, she will complete the rest of the test in half the time.

Answer: 2005\n\nThis question tests a basic understanding of age and time concepts. To solve the problem, you simply need to determine the year when Jorge is 16 years old, based on the information given. The problem tells us that Jorge is 24 years younger than Simon, and that Jorge is 16 years old in 2005. From this information, you can infer that Simon is 16 + 24 = <<16+24=40>>40 years old in 2005.\n\nSince the problem states that Jorge is 16 years old in 2005, we can deduce that the year when Jorge is 16 years old is the same as the year when Simon is 40 years old, which is 2005.

Answer: 200.\n\nI think you meant to write \"basketballs\" instead of \"balls\" in the prompt.\n\nExplanation: In the prompt, you wrote \"100 balls and 10 percent of his balls are basketballs,\" but then in the answer you wrote \"200 balls,\" which doesn't make sense because 100 balls is already the correct answer. So to fix the prompt, you should change \"balls\" to \"basketballs\" to match the answer.", "n_output": -1}

{"ground truth": 1.0, "prediction": "Question: A tiger shark has 180 teeth. A hammerhead shark has 1/6 the number of teeth that a tiger shark has. A great white shark has double the sum of teeth of a tiger shark and a hammerhead shark. How many times fewer teeth does a hammerhead shark have compared to a tiger shark? Answer: 6\n\nExplanation:\nLet's assume the number of teeth that a tiger shark has as n.\nThen, the number of teeth that a hammerhead shark has as m.\nWe know that m = 1/6n.\nAnd, the number of teeth that a great white shark has as 2(n + m).\nWe know that n > m.\nSo, we can write n + m = n.\nTherefore, n - m = n - 1.\nSubtracting m from both sides yields n - m = n - 1.\nTherefore, the number of teeth that a hammerhead shark has is 6 times fewer than that of a tiger shark.", "n_output": -1}
