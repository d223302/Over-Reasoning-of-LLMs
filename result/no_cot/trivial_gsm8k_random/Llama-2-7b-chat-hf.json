To solve this problem, we can use the information given in the problem:\n* A third of Rob's cards are doubles (3/4 of his total cards)\n* Jess has 5 times as many doubles as Rob\n\nSince Jess has 5 times as many doubles as Rob, and Rob has 3/4 of his cards as doubles, we can set up the following equation:\nJess's doubles = (3/4) x Rob's doubles\n\nRearlier, we solved this problem and found that Rob has 24 baseball cards, of which 3/4 are doubles. So, the number of doubles Rob has is 24/3 = 8.\nNow, substituting this value in the equation above, we get:\nJess's doubles = 8 x 5 = 40\n\nSo, Jess has 40 doubles in total, 40 - 8 = 32 more than Rob. \n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is 32.", "n_output": -1}
