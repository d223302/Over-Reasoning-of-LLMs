Therefore, we can set up an equation using the information above:\n\nTotal hours worked = 40 hours/week \u00d7 Number of weeks worked + Overtime hours worked\n\nSubstituting the values given in the question:\n\nTotal hours worked = 40 hours/week \u00d7 1 week + Overtime hours worked\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\nTotal hours worked = 40 hours + Overtime hours worked\n\nNow, we're given that Irene's total earnings are $500, which includes her regular and overtime earnings:\n\nTotal earnings = Regular earnings + Overtime earnings\nTotal earnings = $500\n\nWe can use this information to find the number of overtime hours worked:\n\nOvertime earnings = Total earnings - Regular earnings\nOvertime earnings = $500 - $500(40 hours/week \u00d7 Number of weeks worked)\n\nSimplifying:\n\nOvertime earnings = $500 - $20,000\nOvertime earnings = -$19,500\n\nSince Irene's overtime earnings can't be negative, it means that the calculation is incorrect. The question statement is flawed. The question should have stated that Irene works 40 hours per week for x weeks to earn $500. \n\nTherefore, the question doesn't make sense, and it's not possible to determine how many hours Irene worked last week.", "n_output": -1}

Since Therese is 5 months older than Aivo, we can say that Aivo is 5 months younger than Therese. Therefore, Aivo's age is 5 months less than Jolyn's age.\n\nNow, we can find Leon's age by adding 2 months to Aivo's age. Hence, Leon's age is 5 months less than Jolyn's age + 2 months.\n\nSo, Leon is 7 months older than Aivo (5 months less than Jolyn's age + 2 months).\n\nTherefore, the answer is: Leon is 7 months older than Aivo.", "n_output": -1}

If the question is simple enough, you can omit the step-by-step reasoning and just give the answer. [\\INST]  Let's start by identifying the key information given in the problem:\n\n1. The first tank is twice the size of the second tank.\n2. There are 48 gallons of water in the first tank.\n3. The rule of thumb is one gallon of water per inch of fish.\n\nNow, let's think about how we can use this information to find the answer. Since the first tank is twice the size of the second tank, we can say that the second tank has half the volume of water as the first tank. Therefore, if the first tank has 48 gallons of water, the second tank has 48/2 = 24 gallons of water.\n\nNow, we know that the total volume of water in both tanks is equal to the sum of the volumes of the two tanks. So, we can set up the following equation:\n\n48 + 24 = x\n\nwhere x is the total volume of water in both tanks.\n\nWe know that Gail follows the rule of one gallon of water per inch of fish. Therefore, the total volume of water in both tanks must be equal to the total number of inches of fish in both tanks times one gallon per inch.\n\nSo, we can rewrite the equation as follows:\n\n48 + 24 = (total number of inches of fish in both tanks) x 1 gallon/inch\n\nSince we don't know the total number of inches of fish in both tanks, we can't solve for x yet. However, we can deduce that the total number of inches of fish in both tanks must be equal to the number of inches of fish in the first tank plus the number of inches of fish in the second tank.\n\nTherefore, we can rewrite the equation as follows:\n\n48 + 24 = (number of inches of fish in first tank) + (number of inches of fish in second tank) x 1 gallon/inch\n\nNow, we can plug in the values we know. The number of inches of fish in the first tank is 48/1 = 48 inches, and the number of inches of fish in the second tank is 24/1 = 24 inches.\n\nTherefore, the total number of inches of fish in both tanks is 4", "n_output": -1}

If the question is simple enough, you can omit the step-by-step reasoning and just give the answer. [\\INST]  The worth of ingredients Elizabeth uses to make a bag of granola is $3.00.\n\nTo find this answer, we need to first find the total cost of the ingredients used to make all 20 bags of granola. We can do this by multiplying the number of bags by the cost of ingredients per bag:\n\n20 bags x $3.00/bag = $60.00\n\nNext, we need to find the total revenue from selling all 20 bags of granola. We can do this by multiplying the number of bags sold by the price per bag:\n\n15 bags x $6.00/bag = $90.00\n5 bags x $4.00/bag = $20.00\nTotal revenue = $90.00 + $20.00 = $110.00\n\nSince Elizabeth has not sold all 20 bags of granola, we need to subtract the cost of the ingredients for the unsold bags from the total revenue:\n\n$110.00 - $3.00 x 5 bags = $110.00 - $15.00 = $95.00\n\nNow, we can divide the total revenue by the number of bags sold to find the average price per bag:\n\n$95.00 \u00f7 15 bags = $6.33/bag\n\nSince Elizabeth sells each bag for $6.00, we know that she makes a profit of $6.33 - $6.00 = $0.33 per bag.\n\nTo find the worth of ingredients used to make a bag of granola, we can divide the profit per bag by the number of bags sold:\n\n$0.33 \u00f7 15 bags = $0.022 per bag\n\nTherefore, the worth of ingredients Elizabeth uses to make a bag of granola is $3.00 - $0.022 = $2.978.\n\nAlternatively, we can calculate the worth of ingredients directly by subtracting the revenue from the cost of ingredients:\n\n", "n_output": -1}

[\\INST]  To find the number of visits instead of 2, we need to equate the cost of the discount clinic to the cost of a normal doctor.\n\nLet's say the cost of a visit to the discount clinic is x. Then, the cost of 2 visits would be 2x.\n\nSince the discount clinic is 70% cheaper, the cost of a visit to the discount clinic is 70% of the cost of a visit to a normal doctor. So, we can set up the equation:\n\nx = 0.7 \\* 200\n\nx = 140\n\nNow, we can find the number of visits instead of 2 by dividing the cost of a visit to a normal doctor by the cost of a visit to the discount clinic:\n\n200 / 140 = 1.43\n\nSo, instead of 2 visits, it would take approximately 1.43 visits to the discount clinic to equal the cost of 1 visit to a normal doctor.", "n_output": -1}

[\\INST]  Let's assume the number of students absent is x.\n\nSince one less than three times that number of students are absent, the number of students absent is 2x - 1.\n\nWe know that 2 students are in the restroom, so the total number of students not in the classroom is 2x - 1 + 2 = 2x + 1.\n\nSince Carla is taking attendance, the number of students in the classroom is equal to the total number of students in the class minus the number of students not in the classroom:\n\nTotal number of students in the class - 2x - 1 = 2x + 1\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n2x - 2x - 1 = 2x + 1 - 2x - 1\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n-x = 1\n\nDividing both sides by -1:\n\nx = -1\n\nTherefore, there are 3 students absent.\nThis means there are 3 + 2 = 5 students not in the classroom (3 absent, 2 in the restroom).\n\nSo, 2 students are in the restroom.", "n_output": -1}

[\\INST]  To find out how many visits it takes instead of 2, we need to equate the cost of the discount clinic to the cost of a normal doctor.\n\nLet's say the cost of a visit to the discount clinic is x. Then, the cost of two visits to the discount clinic would be 2x.\n\nWe know that the cost of a visit to a normal doctor is $200, so the cost of two visits to a normal doctor would be $200 + $200 = $400.\n\nSince the discount clinic is 70% cheaper, the cost of two visits to the discount clinic would be 70% of $400, which is $280.\n\nNow, we can set up the equation:\n\n2x = $280\n\nDividing both sides by 2 gives us:\n\nx = $140\n\nSo, the cost of one visit to the discount clinic is $140.\n\nTo find out how many visits it takes instead of 2, we can divide the cost of a normal doctor visit by the cost of a discount clinic visit:\n\n$200 \u00f7 $140 = 1.43 visits\n\nSince you can't have a fraction of a visit, it takes 2 visits to the discount clinic instead of 1 visit to a normal doctor.", "n_output": -1}

{"ground truth": 20.0, "prediction": "[INST] Johnny has been playing guitar for a while now. He practices the same amount each day. As of 20 days ago he had half as much practice as he has currently. How many days ago did he have half as much practice as he has currently? If the question is simple enough, you can omit the step-by-step reasoning and just give the answer. [\\INST]  The answer to this question is 20 days.\n\nTo understand why, let's call the current amount of practice \"x\". Then, 20 days ago, Johnny had half as much practice, which means he had x/2 practice.\n\nSince Johnny practices the same amount each day, his total practice over the past 20 days is equal to 20 times the amount he practices each day, or 20x.\n\nWe know that 20 days ago, Johnny had half as much practice as he has currently, which means that the amount of practice he had 20 days ago was equal to half of the current amount, or x/2.\n\nTherefore, the amount of practice Johnny had 20 days ago was equal to the amount of practice he has currently minus the amount of practice he has had over the past 20 days, or x/2 - 20x.\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get x/2 - 20x = -19x/2.\n\nSince -19x/2 is a negative number, we know that x/2 - 20x cannot be equal to -19x/2. Therefore, our assumption that the amount of practice Johnny had 20 days ago was equal to half of the current amount must be false.\n\nThis means that Johnny did not have half as much practice 20 days ago as he has currently. In fact, he had more practice 20 days ago than he has currently, since he has been practicing the same amount each day and therefore his total practice over the past 20 days is greater than the amount he has practiced in the past 20 days.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is 20 days, since Johnny had more practice 20 days ago than he has currently.", "n_output": -1}

[\\INST]  Let's call Yola's current weight \"Y\".\n\nWe know that Wanda's weight is 30 pounds more than Yola's, so Wanda's weight is \"Y + 30\".\n\nWe also know that Wanda's weight is 80 pounds more than Yola's weight 2 years ago. So, Wanda's weight 2 years ago was \"Y - 80\".\n\nSince Wanda's weight 2 years ago was \"Y - 80\", and Yola's current weight is \"Y\", we can set up the equation:\n\nY + 30 = Y - 80\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n2Y + 30 = -80\n\nSubtracting 30 from both sides:\n\n2Y = -110\n\nDividing both sides by 2:\n\nY = -55\n\nSo, Yola's current weight is 55 pounds.\n\nWe can now find Wanda's weight by adding 30 pounds to Yola's weight:\n\nWanda's weight = Y + 30 = 55 + 30 = 85 pounds.\n\nTherefore, Wanda weighs 85 pounds, which is 30 pounds more than Yola's current weight of 55 pounds.", "n_output": -1}

{"ground truth": 3.0, "prediction": "[INST] The age of Gladys is equal to twice the sum of the ages of Billy and Lucas. Billy is 3 times younger than Gladys who is 30 years old now. How many times younger is Billy compared to Gladys? If the question is simple enough, you can omit the step-by-step reasoning and just give the answer. [\\INST]  Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The age of Gladys is equal to twice the sum of the ages of Billy and Lucas.\n\nLet's call the age of Billy \"b\" and the age of Lucas \"l\". Then we can write:\n\nGladys' age = 2(b + l)\n\n2. Billy is 3 times younger than Gladys.\n\nThis means that Billy's age is 3 times less than Gladys' age. We can write:\n\nb = 3(2(b + l) - 30)\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n\nb = 6b + 6l - 90\n\n3. Now we can solve for b:\n\nb = 6b + 6l - 90\nb = 6(6b + 6l - 10) - 90\nb = 36b + 36l - 180\n\nSimplifying further, we get:\n\n36b + 36l = 180\n\nDividing both sides by 36, we get:\n\nb + l = 5\n\n4. Since Billy is 3 times younger than Gladys, we know that Gladys is 3 times older than Billy. Therefore, we can write:\n\nGladys' age = 3b + 3l\n\nSubstituting the expression we derived in step 3, we get:\n\nGladys' age = 3(b + l)\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nGladys' age = 3(5)\nGladys' age = 15\n\nSo Gladys' age is 15 years old.\n\nTherefore, Billy is 3 times younger than Gladys, which means that Billy is 5 - 3 = 2 years old.\n\nLucas' age can be found by substituting the values we found for Billy and Gladys into the equation we derived in step 1:\n\nLucas' age = 2(b + l)\nLucas' age = 2(5)\nLucas' age = 10\n\nTherefore, the ages of the three children are:\n\n", "n_output": -1}

{"ground truth": 31.0, "prediction": "[INST] A man is trying to maximize the amount of money he saves each month. In particular, he is trying to decide between two different apartments. The first apartment costs $800 per month in rent and will cost an additional $260 per month in utilities. The second apartment costs $900 per month and will cost an additional $200 per month in utilities. The first apartment is slightly further from the man's work, and the man would have to drive 31 miles per day to get to work. The second apartment is closer, and the man would only have to drive 21 miles to get to work. According to the IRS, each mile a person drives has an average cost of 58 cents. How many miles per day would the man have to drive to get to work from the first apartment? If the question is simple enough, you can omit the step-by-step reasoning and just give the answer. [\\INST]  To calculate the number of miles the man would have to drive to get to work from the first apartment, we need to add up the cost of rent, utilities, and transportation costs.\n\nFor the first apartment, the monthly rent is $800, and the monthly utilities cost is $260. So the total cost per month for the first apartment is:\n\n$800 (rent) + $260 (utilities) = $1,060\n\nThe man would also have to drive 31 miles per day to get to work, which would result in a monthly transportation cost of:\n\n31 miles/day \\* 30 days/month = 930 miles/month\n930 miles/month \\* 58 cents/mile = $541.40/month\n\nSo, the total cost per month for the first apartment, including rent, utilities, and transportation, would be:\n\n$1,060 (rent + utilities) + $541.40 (transportation) = $1,601.40/month\n\nNow, let's compare this to the second apartment. The monthly rent for the second apartment is $900, and the monthly utilities cost is $200. So the total cost per month for the second apartment is:\n\n$900 (rent) + $200 (utilities) = $1,100\n\nThe man would have to drive 21 miles per day to get to work from the second apartment, resulting in a monthly transportation cost of:\n\n21 miles/day \\* 30 days/month = 630 miles/month\n630 miles/month \\* 58 cents/mile = $367.40/month\n\nSo, the total cost per month for the second apartment, including rent, utilities, and transportation, would be:\n\n$1,100 (rent + utilities) + $367.40 (transportation) = $1,467.40/month\n\nBased on these calculations, it appears that the second apartment is the better choice, as it has a lower total", "n_output": -1}

We know that Susy gained 40 followers in the first week, so she had 100 + 40 = 140 followers at the start of the second week. We also know that she gained half of that, or 70 followers, in the second week, so she had 140 + 70 = 210 followers at the start of the third week.\n\nUsing the same logic, we can determine that Sarah had 50 + 90 = 140 followers at the start of the second week, and 140 + 40 = 180 followers at the start of the third week.\n\nNow, we can set up a system of linear equations:\n\nSusy's followers at start of third week = x\nSusy's followers at start of second week = 140\nSusy's followers at start of first week = 100\nSarah's followers at start of third week = 180\nSarah's followers at start of second week = 140\nSarah's followers at start of first week = 50\n\nSolving this system of equations, we get:\n\nx = 210\n140 = 210 - 40\n100 = 210 - 70\n180 = 210 + 40\n140 = 210 + 30\n50 = 210 + 20\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n210 = 800 - 40\n\nTherefore, there are 800 students at the large school that Susy attends.", "n_output": -1}

The father dug a hole at a rate of 4 feet per hour.\n2. Michael wants to dig a hole 400 feet less deep than twice the depth of the hole that his father dug.\n3. So, the depth of the hole that Michael wants to dig is 400 feet less than 2 times the depth of the hole that his father dug.\n4. We can simplify this by using the fact that the father dug a hole at a rate of 4 feet per hour.\n5. Therefore, the depth of the hole that the father dug is 4 feet per hour x (some number of hours).\n6. Since Michael wants to dig a hole 400 feet less deep, the depth of the hole that Michael wants to dig is 4 feet per hour x (some number of hours) - 400 feet.\n7.

If the question is simple enough, you can omit the step-by-step reasoning and just give the answer. [\\INST]  To find out how much worth of items Christine sold this month, we need to first find her total earnings from the sales. We can do this by multiplying the amount she sold ($24,000) by her commission rate (12%):\n\nEarnings = $24,000 x 12%\nEarnings = $2,880\n\nNext, we need to find out how much of her earnings will be allocated to her personal needs. We are given that 60% of her earnings will be allocated to her personal needs, so we can calculate this amount as follows:\n\nPersonal Needs = $2,880 x 60%\nPersonal Needs = $1,728\n\nNow, we need to find out how much of her earnings will be saved. We can do this by subtracting the amount allocated to personal needs from her total earnings:\n\nSavings = $2,880 - $1,728\nSavings = $1,152\n\nFinally, we can find out how much worth of items Christine sold this month by dividing her total earnings by her commission rate:\n\nItems Sold = $2,880 \u00f7 12%\nItems Sold = $24,000\n\nTherefore, Christine sold $24,000 worth of items this month.", "n_output": -1}

So he earns $10x.\n* He spends half of his earnings, which is $40/2 = $20, on a new wheelbarrow.\n* Someone pays him double the price of the wheelbarrow, which is $20 x 2 = $40.\n* So the farmer earns a total of $40 + $10x + $40 = $90 + $10x.\n\nSince the problem states that the farmer earns $100, we know that $90 + $10x = $100.\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\n$10x = $100 - $90\n$10x = $10\nx = 10\n\nSo the farmer sold 10 ducks and earned a total of $100.", "n_output": -1}

If the question is simple enough, you can omit the step-by-step reasoning and just give the answer. [\\INST]  The answer to the question is $80.\n\nHere's how we arrive at this answer:\n\n1.

So, the value of the mower after six months is $100 x 75% = $75.\n4. Over the next year, the value of the mower dropped another 20%, which means it was worth 80% of its original price.\n5. So, the value of the mower after one year is $75 x 80% = $60.\n6.

If the question is simple enough, you can omit the step-by-step reasoning and just give the answer. [\\INST]  Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1.

The number of students who didn't turn up for the class on the second day was twice the number of students who didn't turn up on the third day.\n3. On the third day, 1/7 of the total number of students of the class called in sick.\n\nNow, let's try to find the number of students who were present on the second day:\n\nLet X be the number of students who were present on the first day.\nThe number of students who were present on the second day is X + 40.\n\nThe number of students who didn't turn up for the class on the second day is twice the number of students who didn't turn up on the third day, so let's call the number of students who didn't turn up on the third day \"Y\". Then, the number of students who didn't turn up on the second day is 2Y.\n\nOn the third day, 1/7 of the total number of students of the class called in sick, so the number of students who were absent on the third day is 1/7 \\* (X + 40) = (1/7)X + 40/7.\n\nNow, we have a system of equations:\n\n1. X + 40 = (X + 40) - 2Y\n2. (1/7)X + 40/7 = Y\n\nSolving for X, we get:\n\nX = 110\n\nSo, there were 110 students present on the first day, and 150 students present on the second day (110 + 40).\n\nTherefore, there were 50 more students present on the second day compared to the first day (150 - 110 = 50).", "n_output": -1}

[\\INST]  Let's break down the total cost of fixing the car:\n\n* Two parts, each costing $20 = $40\n* Labor cost = $0.5/minute x number of minutes worked\n\nSince the total cost is $220, we can set up an equation:\n\n$40 + (number of minutes worked x $0.5) = $220\n\nTo find the number of minutes worked, we can divide the total cost by the labor cost per minute:\n\nnumber of minutes worked = $220 / $0.5 = 440 minutes\n\nNow we can plug in the values we know into the equation:\n\n$40 + (440 minutes x $0.5) = $220\n\n$40 + $220 = $220\n\nSubtracting $40 from both sides:\n\n$180 = $220 - $40\n\nSubtracting $40 from $220 gives us the cost of the parts:\n\n$180 = $220 - $40\n\n$180 = $180\n\nTherefore, each part costs $180 / 2 = $90.", "n_output": -1}

If the number of books on top of each table is 2/5 times the number of tables, that means we can find the number of books on top of each table by multiplying the number of tables by 2/5.\n\nSo, if we know the number of tables, we can find the total number of books on top of all the tables by multiplying the number of tables by 2/5.\n\nThe problem states that the number of books on top of each table is equal to 2/5 times the number of tables. Therefore, the total number of books on top of all the tables is equal to 2/5 times the total number of tables.\n\nNow, we are given that the total number of books on top of all the tables is equal to 500. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\n2/5 \\* Total number of tables = 500\n\nTo solve for the total number of tables, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 5:\n\nTotal number of tables = 500 \\* 5\n\nTotal number of tables = 2500\n\nTherefore, there are 2500 tables in the class.", "n_output": -1}

First, let's calculate the number of vampires removed. Since Van Helsing removes half the vampires, the number of vampires removed is equal to half the total number of vampires.\n2. Since there are 4 times as many werewolves as vampires, the number of werewolves removed is 4 times the number of vampires removed.\n3.

Therefore, the total amount he earns from removing vampires and werewolves is:\n\n$$5 \\times \\text{number of vampires removed} + 10 \\times \\text{number of werewolves removed} = 105$$\n4.

[\\INST]  The length of the iron bar is not given in the problem statement, only its cross-sectional dimensions are given as 12cm, 8cm, and 6cm. hence the length of the iron bar cannot be determined from the given information.\n\nThe volume of the iron bar can be found by multiplying its cross-sectional dimensions:\nVolume of iron bar = length x width x height = 12cm x 8cm x 6cm = 576 cubic cm. \nSince each iron ball has a volume of 8 cubic cm, ten iron bars would produce:\n10 iron bars x 576 cubic cm/iron bar = 5760 cubic cm\n\nWe can see that 5760 cubic cm is equivalent to 720 iron balls (5760/8 = 720). Therefore, ten iron bars could only produce 720 iron balls, not 1000 as stated in the prompt. \n\nA possible length for the iron bar would be 10cm, making its volume: \n10cm x 12cm x 8cm = 960 cubic cm. \nThis would allow for the production of 120 iron balls per bar (960/8 = 120), or 1200 iron balls for ten iron bars, which is still short of the desired 1000 iron balls stated in the prompt. \nIt's important to note that the dimensions of the iron bar have been assumed to be in the proportions of 12:8:6 (or 3:2:1).

There are 12\" in 1', so 5\" is equal to 0.417 feet (5/12 = 0.417).\n\nNext, we need to determine the height of the curtains. If they are floor-to-ceiling, then the height will be from the floor to the ceiling, which is typically around 8' to 10' (96\" to 120\") depending on the room. For this example, let's assume the height of the curtains is 96\" (8').\n\nTo calculate the additional material needed, we can use the following formula:\n\nAdditional material = (Height of curtains - 5\") x (Width of curtains)\n\nIn this case, the width of the curtains is not specified, so we'll assume it's a standard width of 54\" (4.5').\n\nNow we can plug in the numbers:\n\nAdditional material = (96\" - 5\") x 54\"\nAdditional material = 91\" x 54\"\nAdditional material = 4944\"\n\nNow, we need to convert 4944\" back to feet:\n\n4944\" / 12\" = 412.83 feet\n\nSo Cynthia wants 412.83 additional feet of material for the floor-to-ceiling curtains to achieve the desired pooling effect.", "n_output": -1}

The moving company has helpfully provided Hasan with a digital scale that will alert him if a package is too heavy. Hasan is in the kitchen, and he fills a cardboard box with 38 dinner plates. When he checks the box, the scale reports his box is too heavy. Hasan knows each of his plates weighs 10 ounces. He removes a single plate from the box and checks the movers\u2019 scale again. The scale reports his box is still too heavy. Hasan repeats the process again and again. When he has removed enough plates, the movers\u2019 scale shows the box is now an acceptable weight for shipping.

If the question is simple enough, you can omit the step-by-step reasoning and just give the answer. [\\INST]  Each of Hasan's plates weighs 10 ounces, which is equivalent to 0.625 pounds.\n\nTo calculate this, we know that Hasan removes plates from the box until the scale reports the box is not too heavy. Let's call the number of plates he removes \"x\".\n\nThe total weight of the plates in the box is 38 plates x 0.625 pounds/plate = 24 pounds\n\nSince Hasan removes plates until the scale reports the box is not too heavy, we know that 24 pounds is greater than the maximum weight allowed by the movers.\n\nTherefore, we can set up the equation:\n\n24 pounds = 20 pounds + x plates\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = 4 plates\n\nThus, Hasan removes 4 plates from the box to bring the weight below the maximum allowed weight of 20 pounds.\n\nSince each plate weighs 0.625 pounds, we know that the weight of each plate is:\n\n0.625 pounds/plate = 4 plates/20 pounds\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n0.625 pounds/plate = 0.2 pounds/plate\n\nTherefore, each of Hasan's plates weighs 0.2 pounds or 10 ounces.", "n_output": -1}

If the question is simple enough, you can omit the step-by-step reasoning and just give the answer. [\\INST]  Let's start by using the information that Joseph had twice as many blue socks as he had of red socks. This means that for every pair of red socks, he had two pairs of blue socks.\n\nWe also know that he had three more pairs of blue socks than he had pairs of black socks. This means that if he had x pairs of black socks, he had x+3 pairs of blue socks.\n\nWe also know that he had one less pair of red socks than he had pairs of white socks. This means that if he had y pairs of white socks, he had y-1 pairs of red socks.\n\nFinally, we know that he counted a total of 6 red socks. Since each pair of socks contains two socks, this means that he had 6/2 = 3 pairs of red socks.\n\nSo, to summarize, we have the following equations:\n\n* Twice as many blue socks as red socks: 2x = 3y\n* Three more pairs of blue socks than black socks: x+3 = y\n* One less pair of red socks than white socks: y-1 = 3\n\nNow we can solve for x and y:\n\n* 2x = 3y\n* x+3 = y\n* y-1 = 3\n\nSolving these equations simultaneously, we get:\n\n* x = 3\n* y = 6\n\nSo Joseph had 3 pairs of black socks, 3 pairs of red socks, 6 pairs of blue socks, and 6 pairs of white socks.", "n_output": -1}

If the question is simple enough, you can omit the step-by-step reasoning and just give the answer. [\\INST]  Sure! If Bethany saw 4 times more still lifes than portraits, then for every portrait she saw, she saw 4 still lifes.\n\nSo, if we let \"P\" represent the number of portraits and \"S\" represent the number of still lifes, we can write:\n\nP + 4S = total number of paintings Bethany saw\n\nWe know that the total number of paintings Bethany saw is 24, so we can substitute this value into the equation:\n\nP + 4S = 24\n\nNow, we can solve for P:\n\nP = 24 - 4S\n\nSince Bethany saw 4 times more still lifes than portraits, we know that S = 4P. Substituting this into the equation above, we get:\n\nP = 24 - 4(4P)\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nP = 24 - 16P\n\n16P = 24 - P\n\n17P = 24\n\nP = 24/17\n\nTherefore, Bethany saw 24/17 portraits and 24/17 \\* 4 = 16 still lifes.\n\nSo, Bethany saw 4 times as many still lifes as portraits.", "n_output": -1}

{"ground truth": 50.0, "prediction": "[INST] Pat is hunting for sharks to take photos. For every photo he takes he earns $15. He sees a shark about every 10 minutes. His boat fuel costs $50 an hour. How much does his boat fuel cost per hour? If the question is simple enough, you can omit the step-by-step reasoning and just give the answer. [\\INST]  Sure! To find Pat's boat fuel cost per hour, we need to first find his hourly earnings from taking photos.\n\nLet's assume he takes a photo every 10 minutes, so he takes 6 photos per hour (60 minutes / 10 minutes per photo = 6).\n\nHe earns $15 for each photo, so his hourly earnings are:\n\n$15 per photo x 6 photos per hour = $90 per hour\n\nNow, we know that Pat's boat fuel costs $50 per hour. So, to find his boat fuel cost per hour, we can simply subtract his hourly earnings from his fuel cost:\n\n$50 per hour - $90 per hour = -$40 per hour\n\nWait, what? That can't be right! How can Pat's boat fuel cost be negative?\n\nWell, it turns out that Pat is actually earning more money from taking photos than he's spending on boat fuel. In other words, his photo-taking activity is subsidizing his fuel cost.\n\nTo make the calculation more meaningful, let's assume that Pat also has other expenses related to his shark-hunting activity, such as equipment maintenance, transportation costs, and insurance. If we factor these expenses into the calculation, Pat's true hourly cost for boat fuel would be higher than the negative amount we calculated.\n\nTherefore, we can safely say that Pat's boat fuel cost per hour is not simply $50, but rather a complex function of his earnings, expenses, and other factors related to his shark-hunting activity.", "n_output": -1}

{"ground truth": 30.0, "prediction": "[INST] During a unit on probability, a teacher surveys her class asking her students two questions. The first question was whether they prefer dogs or cats, and the second question was whether they movies or video games. Of the 30 students in her class, 50% chose dogs and video games as their two answers, while 10% chose dogs and movies as their two answers. How many students are there in her class? If the question is simple enough, you can omit the step-by-step reasoning and just give the answer. [\\INST]  There are 30 students in the teacher's class.\n\nTo find the number of students, we can use the information given in the problem. We know that 50% of the students chose dogs and video games, and 10% chose dogs and movies. Therefore, the total number of students who chose dogs is 50% + 10% = 60%.\n\nSince 60% of the students chose dogs, the number of students who chose cats is 100% - 60% = 40%.\n\nWe also know that 50% of the students chose video games. Therefore, the number of students who chose movies is 100% - 50% = 50%.\n\nNow, we can create a Venn diagram with two overlapping circles, one for dogs and cats, and the other for movies and video games. The overlap represents the students who chose both dogs and video games.\n\nThe area of the overlap is 50% \\* 50% = 25%. Therefore, the number of students in the overlap is 25% of 30, which is 7.5. Since we can't have a fraction of a student, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 8.\n\nSo, there are 8 students in the teacher's class who chose both dogs and video games.\n\nThe remaining 22 students can be divided into two groups: those who chose dogs but not video games, and those who chose video games but not dogs. We know that 10% of the students chose dogs and movies, so the number of students who chose dogs but not video games is 10% - 8% = 2%.\n\nSimilarly, the number of students who chose video games but not dogs is 50% - 8% = 42%.\n\nTherefore, the final breakdown of the class is:\n\n* 8 students chose both dogs and video games.\n* 2 students chose dogs but not video games.\n* 42 students chose video games but not dogs.\n* 40 students chose cats.\n\nAdding up all these numbers gives us a total of 30 students in the teacher's class.", "n_output": -1}
